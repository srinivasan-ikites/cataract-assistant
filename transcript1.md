 
00:16:37
 
Srinivasan H: So, you can take your time.
gitanjali baveja: I'll take my time ask more questions.
Srinivasan H: You can ask a
gitanjali baveja: I'll I'll get one of my friends to do it,
Srinivasan H: question.
gitanjali baveja: too. Just so we can kind of both of us I can get two people to look. But I want to do it myself
Srinivasan H: H okay.
gitanjali baveja: first.
Srinivasan H: Uh because uh here we have written some certain prompts. Okay. To the LLM. If you feel the answers are not coming properly or uh it is not aligned properly, you and I can sit and work on the prompt. uh the prompt is nothing but how we are giving the uh LLM to act what uh role we are giving the LLM to act and how it needs to respond so if we correct that I think the answers also we can expect how we want okay so we can work on that prompt as well if the answers are not
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: proper okay uh and uh okay now let's come back to this uh I was asking you before your uh internet got shut down so here I was asking should we keep this anatomical view also or
 
 
00:17:36
 
gitanjali baveja: Like let's let's see the Yeah,
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: that's looks really good. Are we allowed is that is that image something that's AI created or is
Srinivasan H: uh because uh yes it's an
gitanjali baveja: that allowed to use that?
Srinivasan H: AI created image.
gitanjali baveja: There's no copyright on this or anything.
Srinivasan H: Uh I don't think so because this is created by uh we'll have an AI icon here. I think I have removed it but I think so we have to keep that uh AI logo here. If we keep that I think it's allowed because we are showing that we have created through AI or we can
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: write here a description uh that we have created this by AI.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. As long you do this legally,
Srinivasan H: What do you say?
gitanjali baveja: I don't want to get in
Srinivasan H: Huh?
gitanjali baveja: trouble.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh,
gitanjali baveja: You know that one of the things though like it's interesting if you go back to that for just a second.
 
 
00:18:40
 
gitanjali baveja: You know that the the cataract part is right.
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: Correct. Right. Where it shows on the anatomical view on the right side where it's the unhealthy. Move that arrow so the whole thing's unhealthy. Move it to the left. Yeah. The other way. Yeah. So, it's interesting like that those spoking those radial spokes, they shouldn't be on the iris. They should be on the lens inside.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: The image.
gitanjali baveja: Like the image is slightly wrong. Like um let me show you um
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Google a cortical cataract real quick on another tab. And I'll show you what I mean. It shouldn't, you know, it should not show up on the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. And search that.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Look at the images on that. You see the spokes? They're on the inside like those bicycles. Look at the right image.
 
 
00:19:47
 
gitanjali baveja: The one Yeah.
Srinivasan H: This one.
gitanjali baveja: You see how it looks like little bicycle folks? like the radial folks that you see them those
Srinivasan H: Huh? H.
gitanjali baveja: lines it looks like a bicycle wheel right
Srinivasan H: Uh. Yes.
gitanjali baveja: those lines should be in the cataract not on the not on the brown part of the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: eye
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: that's a slightly wrong picture let's
Srinivasan H: Mhm. Okay. I'll
gitanjali baveja: see so the pupil which is the black
Srinivasan H: change.
gitanjali baveja: part should be larger so you can see more of the cataract inside and you can see the unhealthy cataract.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: See how the it's inside the pupil behind the iris and the in the middle picture you see the pupil's dilated really well. It's lot you see the circle is really large,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? That shows the cat. In our picture, the circle's small.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
 
 
00:20:49
 
gitanjali baveja: You only see a little tiny bit of the cataract. You see that circle should be here and those spokes should be inside the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: circle.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. The image part uh I'll change it.
gitanjali baveja: Now take a look at let's take a look at nuclear sclerosis and see if it does a rendition. Let's just make sure it looks right. Okay. And let's go the other way. Scroll to the right. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: Then let's do um
Srinivasan H: cool.
gitanjali baveja: posterior subcapsular and scroll. That's kind of hard to see, but it Google a posterior subcapsular real quick. It's posterior. P O S T E R
Srinivasan H: Uh yeah, I just take it from here
gitanjali baveja: like I'll just copy paste and go
Srinivasan H: cuz I'm not used to those words.
gitanjali baveja: to for a
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: second and you see that image all the way on the
 
 
00:22:28
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. This
gitanjali baveja: You know how like it's a very focal defect?
Srinivasan H: one
gitanjali baveja: It's not like throughout the whole lens, but it's like a a patch of the lens. See the where it's highlighted to the right? Like it looks like a little like a yellowish color in the middle. Yeah, that's the posterior subcapsular. Now, you can also see it in the first image.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Look at the first image. You see how it's normal on the left side, but on that band of light, you can see the yellowish kind of haze. So,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: it's that's a posterior subcapsular. So, our pictures are not that accurate except the nuclear sclerosis.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And you see how much bigger the pupil is, the the round part. So, you can actually see the cataract. So I think our pupils should be bigger image so we can see the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: cataract. You know which circle I'm talking about, right?
 
 
00:23:42
 
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes. I got it.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay, like I think I'll take your help to generate the images as well because uh you can as it generates you can see the image as well whether it is okay or what because I'm not sure whatever image it provides I just used it uh uh yes we
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: can work on that one thing uh at the end it is just a five
gitanjali baveja: Let's make a bit bigger so that you can actually see the cat. You can barely see it cuz that pupil is so small.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You see what I'm
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes. Got
gitanjali baveja: saying?
Srinivasan H: it. Okay. Uh uh. Do we need this one?
gitanjali baveja: Which one?
Srinivasan H: Uh this uh
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, let's look and see what happens when they I mean it's very rare,
Srinivasan H: con
gitanjali baveja: but let's take a look. Let's look at the image. That's not really that much of a Yeah,
 
 
00:24:57
 
Srinivasan H: Huh? Okay. We will change the
gitanjali baveja: the images.
Srinivasan H: images.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, the nuclear scosis was the best image, but again, we need that pupil bigger so that we can actually see
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it.
Srinivasan H: Uh now uh uh let's talk about the uh uh data inside. You can just check the content inside uh and you can let me know.
gitanjali baveja: So, I read the data when you clicked on it and the data looked accurate.
Srinivasan H: Uh okay. So uh so uh what happens is like uh let's say the patient has got this combined form. So uh apart from that what all other catacts is there dynamically the patient will be able to see the other types of catact. If the patient has got nuclearosis that would come at the top and the rest of the things would be shown as other catacts. So that will help them. And uh uh
gitanjali baveja: I the font size in this text should be larger.
Srinivasan H: then
gitanjali baveja: Think about it.
 
 
00:26:03
 
gitanjali baveja: These are people who can't read and can't see.
Srinivasan H: uh Okay. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: They're not going to be able to see such fine
Srinivasan H: Got it.
gitanjali baveja: print.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It should be larger.
Srinivasan H: Font size.
gitanjali baveja: Definitely larger.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And even the the headings primary diagnosis combined form like everything should be proportionately
Srinivasan H: Uh okay. Okay. The font size I'll note it down.
gitanjali baveja: larger.
Srinivasan H: Uh uh got it. Uh okay. Uh that is one thing. And uh okay this also I'll increase the font size. Uh what about the uh data content here?
gitanjali baveja: Yes, that's
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: good.
Srinivasan H: Uh so what I'm thinking is this looks like a plain text. So I will uh uh summarize this and put it a bit more down. And uh the main main points I'll try to put it in points so that it'll be better for them to uh easily read. What do you say?
 
 
00:27:16
 
Srinivasan H: A bit change in the format of displaying it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Huh? Okay. And I think I'll keep a button here. Uh it is like an audio. If they don't want to read it, uh they can click on that so that uh it'll come as an audio.
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
Srinivasan H: They can hear it as well. Okay. Uh these two things I wanted to change.
gitanjali baveja: good.
Srinivasan H: And uh frequently asked questions. Uh there's also font size I need to increase. Uh I'll increase it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh uh rest everything is clear
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, I think I'll have to just go through each one and make sure the data is clear.
Srinivasan H: right?
gitanjali baveja: like it would be take too long to read each module and look at the data from and tell
Srinivasan H: Huh? Yes you
gitanjali baveja: you like thoroughly at it and see let's just take a glance at everything make sure
Srinivasan H: can.
gitanjali baveja: there's nothing big that we need to change and then I'll look at the data more in detail before we I don't think like I don't know if we it'll I think
 
 
00:28:14
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it'll take a while to do
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it. Uh let's move to the
gitanjali baveja: Okay, I heard that part is good. Let's go down a little bit. And we'll have to give credit for wherever these videos were generated. They were from Academy of Opthalmology. So, we can write down.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: We should give them credit, right?
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: where we're getting these videos from.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Well, in traditional surgery, it needs to say like I like the way it says the surgeon uses a handheld braid to create precise incisions. An ultrasound device is then used to break up and remove the cataract. Right? But we also need to say that um after your uh cloudy lens put cataract and in parenthesis your cloudy lens because people might they need to
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: remember like it needs to be told that cataract just means that their lens is cloudy. It's not like separate thing than the lens.
 
 
00:30:00
 
Srinivasan H: Hm.
gitanjali baveja: The so and because we've already explained in the other what a cataract is but put in parenthesis to break up and remove the cataract and then put parenthesis your cloudy lens and then put in one more sentence we have to say um after your entire after all your lens fragments are removed an implant is carefully placed. It is it is it is carefully replaced by an a lens
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: implant. A a clear lens implant called an O or intraocular lens
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: implant.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So we make that statement. I think it's important because if we don't talk about the lens replacement then that's just half of the surgery.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. I thought that part we will cover it up here. Okay. I think uh we need to add it
gitanjali baveja: Well, tradition it uses a blade, but we also are even in traditional surgery,
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: you're putting an implant. Every surgery, you're putting an implant.
 
 
00:31:08
 
gitanjali baveja: So, they need to they need to know that whatever surgery they're getting, they're getting their implant.
Srinivasan H: Mhm. Got it. Okay. Yeah. I'll add that particular
gitanjali baveja: And then coverage status.
Srinivasan H: part.
gitanjali baveja: You don't ever want to say fully covered, but you say covered by insurance. I know that sounds like the same thing, but it's not because some people have different insurance plans where they're not fully covered. You get what I'm saying? They're partially covered. So, we don't lead the patient thinking they don't have to pay anything. Covered by your insurance plan.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: just say covered by most standard insurance plans. I would just just to have it like a
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: disclaimer
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: instead of saying fully covered because we have to kind of we don't want to be sued, right?
Srinivasan H: Mhm.
gitanjali baveja: So, I would say covered by most standard insurance plans, you know, that's something they can talk to their surgical counselor about.
 
 
00:32:18
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it. And even this video first I thought I will remove it from YouTube. I'll download it and manually put it. But uh then I thought uh later it it might become a problem if we put it like our content.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: So I just put the YouTube link itself.
gitanjali baveja: that's fine. That's fine. And then let's go to Okay, that's good. Um, and
Srinivasan H: uh so this will change dynamically from patient to patient. So if the doctor cues there uh that he is okay for laser then we will get uh this kind of uh Hey,
gitanjali baveja: Okay. You need to put a sentence that after the bladeless computer control laser creates precise incisions. This advanced method offers higher degree that can be kept but then put after these incisions are created by the laser. Your surgeon will still use an ultrasound and then go back to that and copy and paste the information because you still have to get the ultrasound machine to remove the lens fragments and then replace the surgeon still has to put an implant in. Right?
 
 
00:34:01
 
gitanjali baveja: go back up to the regular part.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Um, an ultrasound device is then used to break up and remove the cataract. Subsequently, your surgeon puts a replaces the um your and you put cataract in parentheses your cloudy lens and then subsequently your surgeon will play you know insert an carefully insert an intraocular lens or lens implant clear lens implant. So, you want to put that sentence in there and then everything that I just said starting from an ultrasound device, copy paste, put that after the femtoc. You see what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: Because that part is still part of the surgery there.
Srinivasan H: got it. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Well, is there implant in that one or not in that one?
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It's everything. The only difference is the fact that the incisions are made by a blade versus they're made by a laser. You still have to go and remove the lens lens material and you still have to go and put the implant
 
 
00:35:07
 
Srinivasan H: H got it. Okay. Yeah, I got
gitanjali baveja: in.
Srinivasan H: it. Okay. Uh,
gitanjali baveja: I mean,
Srinivasan H: anything else here?
gitanjali baveja: I think that's good so far.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh, so similarly here FAQs and
gitanjali baveja: In the FAQ,
Srinivasan H: Check.
gitanjali baveja: it should be what is the difference between traditional and laser assisted surgery should be in the FAQ definitely.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then I want to go to the chat bot.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I want to make sure that we have a disclaimer. I should never tell this patient what to do. Um, so go to chat with the assistant. Say, um, where are we?
Srinivasan H: Uh,
gitanjali baveja: Oh, yeah. If you Oh, chat with the assistant.
Srinivasan H: chatbot
gitanjali baveja: Ask it. What type of surgery should I get? Write that down.
Srinivasan H: What type of surgery should I
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, like if you if you were saying,
Srinivasan H: get?
gitanjali baveja: should I get the traditional or should I get the femto?
 
 
00:37:10
 
gitanjali baveja: Because the patient's not going to call it phento second laser. They're going to say, what type of surgery should I get? That's how they're going to answer ask the question. But let's see what it
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: says. So, let's go up for a little bit. No, the other way. The other way. Um,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: scroll to the top where the answer is.
Srinivasan H: Uh, this is the answer,
gitanjali baveja: That's the
Srinivasan H: right? Cat.
gitanjali baveja: answer.
Srinivasan H: Here it starts.
gitanjali baveja: It's good. It tells you what they the doctor has already recommended.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: But what it but they're also a candidate for others. So it doesn't have they don't have to get the laser, right?
Srinivasan H: Uh, yes.
gitanjali baveja: So we don't want this chatbot to say only one option, right? And it says based on your discussions and priorities, you've chosen a tri focal to so why is it what if I haven't chosen it yet?
 
 
00:38:42
 
gitanjali baveja: I'm just trying to understand what my options are.
Srinivasan H: uh okay like uh I think uh your mom whatever the document you gave I think I have uploaded that I think in that we have extracted the uh we had circled something right And that image which you had shared
gitanjali baveja: But I'm just saying general like that's fine from the EMR but we kind of assistant
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: to give them like their options. I don't know. You know what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: uh no one the confusion that I have here is uh uh this is for a particular patient right. So now uh I have given uh the selected uh sheet as well to the uh
gitanjali baveja: Oh,
Srinivasan H: uh uh uh AI uh the patient has selected a particular lens right I think they had selected triocal or something I'm not sure so that was also sent to it so that's why it is
gitanjali baveja: the like where does the
Srinivasan H: answering
gitanjali baveja: patient select the lens in our program?
Srinivasan H: uh uh not that but uh in this particular uh let me show
 
 
00:39:46
 
gitanjali baveja: Because we don't want the patient to select the lens. We want the we want the patient to select the lens after they've looked at all their options. You see what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: H yes I I got your particular point uh uh exactly uh the thing what I'm trying to tell is like uh I have already feeded it what the patient has uh preferred I mean uh you had given a sheet in that EMR if you remember huh
gitanjali baveja: from the from the doctor view.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: So that's why it is giving this kind of
gitanjali baveja: But let's select let's say so we need to give an example where the patient
Srinivasan H: answer.
gitanjali baveja: hasn't selected anything also.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh
gitanjali baveja: So like we need two demo ready so that we can have an example of where the patient hasn't
Srinivasan H: that
gitanjali baveja: selected anything so they can see their options. You see what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: H. Got
gitanjali baveja: This is trying to walk them through the process so that the doctor doesn't have to if they've already
 
 
00:40:36
 
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: walked through the process and and and gone through the appointment and they've decided at the appointment then what's the point of this helping them? You see what I'm saying? So, we need to have like some demo to show like a dumb
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: patient
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I mean the the text is correct though for this particular
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: case.
Srinivasan H: Okay, I got it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh, shall we move on
gitanjali baveja: How about can I get can I get is traditional surgery an option?
Srinivasan H: to Sh Okay, it's still telling that
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: So we need like we need to have it so when in the doctor's view if the doctor clicks on all the options the patient sees that they have those options right and then they can ask the bot what are the differences and what are the benefits and that kind of thing.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay, I got this. I will change this.
 
 
00:42:31
 
gitanjali baveja: You see what I'm trying to get at.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes. Got
gitanjali baveja: All right. So let's go to the next section.
Srinivasan H: it. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And we'll click on that. So again, fully covered is not something we want to write an insurance. We want to buy covered by most standard insurance plans.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Fully. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then we never want to write no glare or halos. We want to write minimal.
Srinivasan H: Oh,
gitanjali baveja: Anybody can have a little bit of glare and halo and they can come back and say you told me
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: not.
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: And also it says requires reading glasses for near tasks um
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and including fine print and computer. So it's not just near also for intermediate range which is computer range
Srinivasan H: Okay. Intermediate. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and we wrote on the left hand side excellent quality of vision for distance.
 
 
00:44:32
 
gitanjali baveja: um when there is low levels with and then you have to put in parenthesis with low levels of a stigmatism because if they have high a stigmatism they're not going to have excellent distance vision they need the toric lens you see what I'm saying
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, okay. Got it. So I have to explicitly mention that uh #matism
gitanjali baveja: I would say excellent quality of for vision for distance in parenthesis
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: provided there is there is minimal aigmatism. Okay. And then in the right side requires reading glasses task and then it says you could
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: say requires glasses for distance if there is a stigmatism as a you need to make that claim.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Glasses provide final best fi for clearest vision
Srinivasan H: Glasses.
gitanjali baveja: patient will need to wear glasses. For distance for reading actually for clearest v vision patient will need to wear glasses.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So,
gitanjali baveja: Patient will like likely need to wear glasses.
Srinivasan H: should I
 
 
00:45:47
 
gitanjali baveja: Um it's so the here's the deal with monopocal if you haveism you have to wear glasses for distance near and intermediate everything to make it clear. Um, if you don't have a stigmatism, you'll have very clear vision far away,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: but you'll need the glasses for near and up and intermediate.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So I have to uh mention it explicitly these
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, because patients need to know.
Srinivasan H: things.
gitanjali baveja: They're that's the biggest question. Do I need glasses? Do I not? Is my vision? Well, yes.
Srinivasan H: Sorry.
gitanjali baveja: your to be clear if you don't have much a stigmatism if you have anything above 0.5 a
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: stigmatism your vis glasses for distance with the monof okay um unless you get correction for a
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: stigmatism
Srinivasan H: Okay, I'll explicitly mention this
gitanjali baveja: but here when you say does not correct a
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: stigmatism you've got two options for a stigmatism ISM correction. If you have a low level of aigmatism, don't forget you can use the laser assisted procedure to correct the estigmatism.
 
 
00:47:08
 
gitanjali baveja: If you have higher levels of aigmatism, you can use the toric lens implant. So where we said here does not you see in this thing it says does not correct a stigmatism and we
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: wrote unless toric version. We did not write unless to you have to you have to also say unless toric version is used or laser aigmatism correction is used. We need to say both
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay. Yes, I got it. What all needs to be changed? Uh, I'll change
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: So the toric option um oh yeah I see was like to modifocal to okay that's fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So do you think we need to add any image for monopocal since it is only text
gitanjali baveja: I don't think there's I mean main yeah main people ask like what are what are we going to do like I don't think we need to show images of the
Srinivasan H: because
gitanjali baveja: lens patient they don't really go that far deep into
 
 
00:48:48
 
Srinivasan H: okay one thing I observed everywhere is we can keep that audio icon So if they don't want to read,
gitanjali baveja: that people.
Srinivasan H: we can keep an audio icon and it can read it off for them.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Multif focal
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's good. Okay, good. But also in the toric option like if they have low levels they don't need to multif focal ol they can also get laser aigmat.
Srinivasan H: God.
gitanjali baveja: So there's always low levels of aigmatism, moderate to high levels of a stigmatism, right? So under the aturic option you can say low level and then moderate to high level.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Low level you can get laser correction for these stigmatism. Moderate high level you can get the toric option that's for every toric right.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Another toric. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So if there's a low level you can it's very low you just you you can do the laser. Some people do the laser, some people do the lens implant, but it's always an option.
 
 
00:50:42
 
gitanjali baveja: It's what the doctor selects, right? From the doctor view.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it. Okay. Yeah, I will make the changes.
gitanjali baveja: So when we write distance to intermediate distance, it might be confusing. I like to count like distance and in parentheses. When I call do distance, I like I write driving vision because that's what you equate to distance, right?
Srinivasan H: Um uh can you come again? I didn't get it.
gitanjali baveja: So like right after the word distance vision you see
Srinivasan H: H yes.
gitanjali baveja: that I would say in parentheses driving vision to
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: intermediate in parenthesis computer vision computer
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: distance you you use the distance word too much.
Srinivasan H: Got it.
gitanjali baveja: They're like what do you mean by distance and distance? Like you see what I'm saying? So I would say I would reword that sentence so that lenses provide a continuous range of high quality vision from distance and parentheses driving vision to interate in parentheses computer vision.
 
 
00:52:34
 
gitanjali baveja: You see what I'm
Srinivasan H: Okay. Good. Yes.
gitanjali baveja: saying?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Um, you know, I would say, um, may still require instead of mild, just put over- the-counter reading glasses.
Srinivasan H: over the
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: counter.
gitanjali baveja: Meaning like you can just go from anywhere and get those over- the-counter glasses for reading. That's kind of considered mild. But people don't know what mild means. you know, know that the over the counter means I can just go to the grocery store and buy those reading glasses.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I don't have to get prescription or anything for
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: them.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then same with the toric, we need one more sentence.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: If you have low levels of a stigmatism, your doctor may al may recommend laser assisted surgery as an alternative to a toric lens option.
Srinivasan H: Yes, I'll add it everywhere.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh uh actually in my understanding I had one doubt like when will a patient uh choose between multif focal or adolf because I I when I read it I felt somewhat both are same like what makes them different for a patient to
 
 
00:54:12
 
gitanjali baveja: So an a multif focal you can see like let's say I was looking at my phone right
Srinivasan H: choose.
gitanjali baveja: here. I can't see that with an eolf. I can see computer out here. So about 20 inches away I can see. Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: But if you bring it closer and it's small print like I'm trying to read a medicine bottle or trying to read a a label for a food like like try to read the ingredients on a package or a recipe. Can't read that with eat off. I need the reading glasses. With the multif focal you get all three ranges.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You get computer, you get up close fine print and distance. So,
Srinivasan H: Uh so multif focal is better than e
gitanjali baveja: so here's the difference, right? And can somehow help me incorporate this.
Srinivasan H: off.
gitanjali baveja: If the if you get a multif focal the downside is that you are accepting that there might be halos and glare that might interfere with night vision.
 
 
00:55:09
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Right? The eatoff is more like a single sheet. So you don't have that halo and glare. It's not like little rings of light. The but you give up your reading a little bit of your reading vision because you might have to wear glasses for
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: reading. The other is in cost. The eat off is about half the cost of a multif focal.
Srinivasan H: okay,
gitanjali baveja: Say spend three $3,500,
Srinivasan H: there it is.
gitanjali baveja: but I don't mind spending $1,500 on the eat off. It just the patient. So the patient might say, "Okay, well, I'll get a little bit of benefit. Maybe I can wear I'll cover my glasses for distance and the computer and I'll get the over the counter occasionally for when I have to read a prescription bottle. I'll deal with it." for h for half the cost,
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: right?
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: So somehow explain
Srinivasan H: got it.
gitanjali baveja: that
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
00:56:08
 
Srinivasan H: But uh for multif focal what you're telling is for an ideal user uh he never wants to wear glasses again but he'll get hallows and glares at night.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: That is a
gitanjali baveja: there's like a small risk of Well,
Srinivasan H: possibility.
gitanjali baveja: there's a I don't want to use the word small, but it's like up to 3% that's reported in the literature. I don't want to use numbers unless we use a proper reference for
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: You can just say there is a chance that you can experience and just say we want to keep this generic as well. Like we don't want anybody to come. Oh, you told me only 3% of the people came and I had this problem. We could just say there's a chance you have this problem and if you have it then we said it
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: right.
Srinivasan H: Got it. Yeah. The last one is added.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
 
 
00:57:12
 
gitanjali baveja: So we definitely need to write some of the green points about this that are very important. Okay. One of the things is this lens
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: is a special type of monop. Well, I should say this lens only provides one range of vision but that can be adjusted after surgery.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Right. So um I wouldn't put can fix residual refractive error
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: without extra surgery. I wouldn't put that sentence. I would just say customi customizable vision after surgery is fine. Um I would say one it provides one range of vision if your lens implant measurements are not clear or not how do I say so what happens is let's say pe some people have inconsistent lens measurements from their master or there. If your lens implants, I would say if your lens implant measurements are not 100% reliable, okay? And you want to put in parenthesis, for example,
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: if you've had prior LASIC surgery or PRK surgery or other spec other other eye surgeries, you may want to consider this as an option because once the lens is implanted, you can adjust the prescription after.
 
 
00:59:00
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay. to put on this orange on the right hand side as a red or like orange
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: alert. This does not provide multiple ranges of vision. It only helps if your lens calculations are not or you know it only allows you to adjust for one range vision after surgery. And then people might ask what's the benefit right just say in this case one eye could your one eye could be set for distance and the other eye could be set for intermediate or or near vision. This allows the patient to decide what visual outcome they would have after they have cataract surgery. But it's not multif focal. If you decide you want distance in one eye and near in one eye or distance in both or whatever you want,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you can decide that after after the fact. But we have to be very clear that it provides one range of vision
Srinivasan H: Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: and to say many people opt for one eye to see clearly for distance and their non-dominant eye to see better for near vision.
 
 
01:00:26
 
gitanjali baveja: So they are less dependent on glasses. These adjustments can be made after surgery and changed after surgery too.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. And I like that you put requires multiple office visits for I would say for don't say light treatments but for the adjustments
Srinivasan H: adjustment. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and that's fine. The ll can also treat a s. That's fine. I like the toric option because you don't even need a toric lens or anything. You get the LA. Okay, that's it. So, you got kind of like what I need to say about this.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes, I understood. I have a picture of it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, we can go back
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: now. Yeah. So now on the frequently asked questions
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: um we don't want to use the word tri focal at all. We want to use multif focal. Remember we want to avoid tri focal.
Srinivasan H: All
gitanjali baveja: Those are for what is a multif focal lens?
 
 
01:01:48
 
gitanjali baveja: What exactly is an ol? Um,
Srinivasan H: right.
gitanjali baveja: on the chatbot I want to write what lens implant should I get? We never should have this software decide make clinical decisions. We can say your doctor let's just say what lens implant should I get? So we need to also match this to the other question where like they see their options like we don't want you know how the doctor can give them multiple options. We don't ever want this to say you should get this can say your doctor has recommended
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: this because you know on the doctor page we could put we want to we don't want to write recommended but we can say the doctor has given you these following options and just say um we
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: cannot recommend just say we should have a disclaimer always speak to your doctor um before deciding what implant you should yet because you don't want the software to say you should get
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: this and then the patient said oh they told me the software said I should get this chatbot do it and I can't believe I did it I hate this so we
 
 
01:03:34
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: any they ask what type of surgery I should get what we need to have some kind of like first sentence that always says disclaimer please talk to your surgeon about your options before making your final decision decision. Your surgeon will help you decide what is the best option for you. These are the following options and we and you can show the options and provide information about the options but we don't give we don't really make a recommendation as to what they should get.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, it shouldn't be like doctor has recommended
gitanjali baveja: Well, I would I mean if the doctor re well if sometimes if the doctor we should on the doctor page right we should put all the options and I don't I think the doctor doesn't recommend 100%
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: one the patient has to right so we want to say the doctor has given you the following options recommended,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? And that way patients can see their options and and then if they say,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: "Well, I don't want to wear glasses." Well,
 
 
01:04:48
 
gitanjali baveja: that's the option. And then you would go with this option. You see what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Because if you write, I think that eventually the doctor can recommend something and they sign paper. That's fine. But for the purposes of the software, we don't want them to be directed too far directed eventually. Yes, when we get this FDA approved, then we can have tell patients. But if it's telling patients what to do clinically, then it has to be approved. So we cannot make recommendations. We can just give options and information. This is a patient education tool and so we need to be very careful with that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay, got it. Uh, yeah, I will refine
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: just to check one
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: thing.
Srinivasan H: then I will think Huh? I think uh I have not worked on this. I thought I'll talk to you and then change it. Uh because uh this well my IOL options and uh cost and insurance.
 
 
01:06:23
 
Srinivasan H: I think some of this will get merged a bit because uh let's say I open my options. He needs to get what the doctor has suggested or something and then he needs to select uh I mean what his preference is right uh so here once he selects his
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: preference we need to calculate the costs and display it to him right uh okay I
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: think I've not worked on this because I was working on the doctor view I I will update you the my
gitanjali baveja: That's that's now you know kind of how it's going
Srinivasan H: options I'll work on it
gitanjali baveja: to fit into all of this, right?
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: Like you have a better understanding.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. So that'll just this we don't really have to go over because you know what to do with
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: this.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes. Uh risk and complications. Okay. I think this is also have not changed. It's still the previous one.
 
 
01:07:17
 
gitanjali baveja: But you have my form,
Srinivasan H: Uh oh.
gitanjali baveja: right?
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes. I have this. Uh I'll change it. Uh okay. before surgery. Okay, there's one I wanted to show you. Okay. Uh can I check this day of surgery?
gitanjali baveja: This is day of surgery eye surgery center. What um blurry vision large pupil scratchy feeling patch check in preop. Um, I wouldn't say a wait time. Check-in and pre prep. Um, you don't want to say that because a lot of times they'll make the patient arrive an hour before their procedure. Sometimes two before the procedure,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: check-in and prep. I would just say track it and prep. Procedure.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Um and then I would say well it depends like so if they get femto second right part of the procedure so checkin and dilation is part of the prep.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: So I'd say check registration is part of the first
 
 
01:09:05
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: not prep but check-in and registration that
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: first
Srinivasan H: Okay. Check in and
gitanjali baveja: um and I would say uh please arrive um
Srinivasan H: registration.
gitanjali baveja: or arrival time 7:30 which whatever arrival time they the the surgical counsel will say they can design the arrival time. Okay. So that's a check-in and prep and and registration because that's when they do the paperwork and all that stuff with the front desk. So then um
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: preparation
Srinivasan H: Preparation.
gitanjali baveja: um just say you are taken back to the pre-operative
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: area where a
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: nurse will will administer the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: pre-operative drops. Um,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: some of those drops will will dilate your pupils. Your pupils may remain dilated for up to 3 days. Okay. Um,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: additional drops. Oh, you you don't have to put you will also meet your anesthesia team and your surgeon prior to the procedure during this time.
 
 
01:10:39
 
Srinivasan H: Uh, okay.
gitanjali baveja: In addition, you will get an IV IV like in
Srinivasan H: I What is
gitanjali baveja: your like you get IV to start the anes to
Srinivasan H: that?
gitanjali baveja: start the anesthesia process.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then there should be a section on anesthesia because people ask what. So the type of an you can put that under this section because that's the day of surgery,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? Um the type of anesthesia that patients get is mild sedation where you are
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: partially awake during surgery. You do not feel any pain or discomfort during the process.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: An anesthesia is administered through the IV.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then procedure just say procedure is approximately 30 minutes.
Srinivasan H: gravy.
gitanjali baveja: Don't put fif the actual procedure is less but I you know they go in there they got to clean the eye then do the procedure then put the patch on then it takes so even though the actual procedure is like 15 minutes it still takes another 15 minutes to do all that junk right so for procedure just say approximately 30 minutes and then
 
 
01:12:26
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: recovery um we want to just say um patient is take but you are taken to the post-operative recovery area where posttop
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: instructions will be given to you. There will be a patch placed over your s o over the eye that had surgery or over your surgery eye and um don't and
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: um a light snack and or rest and snack provided. That's fine. Rest and snack provided.
Srinivasan H: Uh,
gitanjali baveja: But we have to we need to say that you know postoperative medic and and IV will be removed and
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: the nurse will discharge you with discharge paperwork after you see your surgeon
Srinivasan H: H. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and it's important to note that in this process I guess we'll it's somewhere we've written that they need to provide they need to um guess I guess in the preop they need to um arrange for uh transportation, right?
Srinivasan H: Hi. Yes, we'll mention it
gitanjali baveja: Okay. We we should mention that in the preop,
 
 
01:13:45
 
Srinivasan H: there.
gitanjali baveja: not not preop, not day of surgery, but prior to surgery, right?
Srinivasan H: Preop. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Or or not preop, but preop instructions like please arrange for transportation. um you will not be allow they're not allowed to go back in an Uber alone after anesthesia like a so she said please arrange
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: for uh transportation um as you will be allowed to travel alone or drive right after surgery
Srinivasan H: Okay. transportation. Okay. Okay. Uh okay. Uh okay. What else do you think in this day of surgery? Anything else?
gitanjali baveja: I think that's it. That's good enough for now. Oh, I can't I can't think of anything.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and anything about after surgery like some symptoms that they have if they wouldn't call for an emergency. Do we write anything like that?
Srinivasan H: Oh yes, exactly. I I think I've not mentioned anything about that. Okay. Like
gitanjali baveja: I think we separate section on that and just say when to call my
 
 
01:15:21
 
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: doctor.
Srinivasan H: okay to call me doctor.
gitanjali baveja: So the standard thing that we tell patients is if you're experiencing any like just we already said that you will expect blurry vision for a few days blah blah blah if you're experiencing any pain any I would say if you're experiencing significant pain that is not uh improving with over-the-counter Advil or Tylenol. Um if you're experiencing um well redness
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: is just say redness tearing redness and tearing are common but if you're experiencing pain that is not um pain or uh if you're experiencing severe nausea also call your doctor if you see flashes of light if you sleep um any new floaters or additional floaters or a curtain or veil in
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: your vision or significant decline or a significant change in
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: vision
Srinivasan H: H. So,
gitanjali baveja: maybe.
Srinivasan H: will we keep this as a separate section or we'll include it
gitanjali baveja: If you go to day,
Srinivasan H: somewhere?
gitanjali baveja: go to after surgery,
Srinivasan H: Uh, yes.
 
 
01:17:06
 
gitanjali baveja: if you scroll down, you know how you have maintenance care as the one block.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: Let's have a block of when should I call my
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: doctor.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then before we write all the bad symptoms, just say expect some expect your vision to fluctuate especially during the first few days of surgery. Expect tearing just tearing mild tearing, scratchiness, some mild redness. Um, however, if you have any pain blah blah blah, whatever I just said, then you then call your doctor immediately.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Got it. Uh this one shall we put it here itself like uh after surgery a separate block shall
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: I create it?
gitanjali baveja: I think a separate vlog because it's really important that patients are always going to say like when is it an
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: emergency like they have so many problems that they like if somebody's tearing a little bit they don't need to call. They should, but if they're having severe pain or nausea, they should definitely
 
 
01:18:23
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: call
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh okay. I got it. Okay. I I I uh I need some 2 minutes to display this before surgery and after surgery because it depends on the date. Currently when I click on this, it shows uh uh you have completed the preop. So I need to adjust that date in the code. I will just change it and I'll display to you how it works dynamically according to
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: date.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh so just give me two to three
gitanjali baveja: No, take your
Srinivasan H: minutes.
gitanjali baveja: time. I'm going to go um get some water. I'll be back.
Srinivasan H: Oh,
gitanjali baveja: I hear you.
Srinivasan H: yes. Yes. Sure.
gitanjali baveja: So,
Srinivasan H: Sure.
gitanjali baveja: you just like shout out when you meet me back.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I'm going to make some tea.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes.
gitanjali baveja: We're going to get a giant snowstorm on
 
 
01:19:21
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Sunday.
Srinivasan H: So
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, we're supposed to get 15 in of
Srinivasan H: strong.
gitanjali baveja: snow.
Srinivasan H: Uh during that time uh no one gets out or how is it? You stay at home.
gitanjali baveja: Uh yeah, I can't drive in that
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: weather.
Srinivasan H: Okay, just a minute. uh G do you want to see the uh doctor's view once because it's ready. If you want to see it later, I can show you later as well. But it is ready now. If you want I can show you that now and later show the after surgery and before surgery how do you
gitanjali baveja: Um, what should we do?
Srinivasan H: want
gitanjali baveja: It's already been like a maybe like a next call. You think an hour and a half now?
Srinivasan H: uh okay uh then uh this uh doctor's view is already there I don't think so there's much changes I just want you to look into it the UI I've changed the UI okay
gitanjali baveja: Show me the doctor's view and then
Srinivasan H: Just
gitanjali baveja: um I can see that we can work on the patient view with those other changes and then with those changes I can take a look at the patient view as well as the before and after surgery.
Srinivasan H: okay. Oh yeah. Uh G, I'll join the call in a minute. I think my system is lagging. I'll just close this window and open it
gitanjali baveja: I'll just pause
Srinivasan H: again.
gitanjali baveja: myself.
Srinivasan H: Okay, I think it is Uh, okay. Can you confirm me whether you're able to view it? Okay. Uh so the clinical data uh I think I displayed this previously to you right? Uh now turn off the video. Uh now are you able to hear? Uh, hello.

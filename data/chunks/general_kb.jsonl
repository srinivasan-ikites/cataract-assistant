In adults, cataracts happen after the eyes and vision develop. Most adults have good vision again after they have their cataracts removed.

In some cases, only one of the conditions may need to be addressed. If the visual decline is mainly due to the cataract, and cataract surgery can be done without causing the cornea to permanently swell, then cataract surgery alone is the preferred treatment option. If Fuchs' dystrophy is the major cause for the symptoms, sometimes a transplant alone is performed without touching the cataract. If your ophthalmologist believes that performing cataract surgery will cause the Fuchs' dystrophy to permanently swell, or if performing a corneal transplant will cause the cataract to become visually significant, he or she may opt to do a combined procedure (cataract surgery along with a partial or full thickness corneal transplant). My personal preference is not to do them at the same time, but instead to stage them one after the other. I often do the cataract surgery first to see if the cornea will recover prior to deciding if a transplant will be necessary. Unfortunately, this strategy calls for multiple trips to the operating room rather than getting it all done at the same time. Ophthalmologists have their own personal preference and you should discuss these issues with your doctor.

It is much safer than the bladed surgery used before YAG that I know of no doctor that would not advise YAG laser for capsulotomy. There is no pain whatsoever.

In fact, general anesthesia is still used for this needle/knife procedure in children. The surgical risks are still very low, but definitely higher than YAG.

Astigmatism is the name we give to a cornea that looks more like a football than a basketball. For example, if you picture a football lying on a clock face with the long axis running from 3:00 to 9:00, the curvature is steeper in the axis at 12:00 on the clock face and flatter in the axis at 3:00, 90 degrees away. This is called \"regular\" astigmatism. This difference in the curvature produces two or more focus points on the retina which creates blurred vision. Eyeglasses and contact lenses are used to correct astigmatism and can produce excellent vision. There are times when a person might wish to correct his/her astigmatism with surgery to remove this astigmatism and it is common to do this at the time of cataract surgery, either with a toric implant lens or with limbal reading incisions. However, if the axis of astigmatism does not line up to make a perfect cross (perpendicular lines) then it is called \"irregular\" astigmatism and may require a hard contact lens or corneal surgery to correct. Limbal relaxing incisions correct regular astigmatism by flattening the overly steep curves in the cornea.", "token_count": 296, "chunk_id": "b7bb92a78cf912689794f187e3a91d8f3e5ab8af_chunk_0", "chunk_index": 0}

There are really two different aspects to recovering after cataract surgery: one that deals with the healing of the eye and the other deals with the final clearness of vision. The \"recovery\" from surgery is not prolonged with the relaxing incisions. There can be a mild scratchy feeling for a few days, but this seldom causes any recovery issue.

The standard IOL that most insurance companies pay for has a single focus that you and your ophthalmologist agree upon. There are three basic zones of vision: far (driving), intermediate (computer) and near (reading). A standard IOL gives you one of these three zones and the other two usually require eyeglasses to achieve good vision. Other factors such as pupil size and the amount of light available can impact how well these people see for the other two zones of vision. Targeting that focus is not a perfectly accurate process, but usually the result is very close to your desired single visual goal.

If it is strabismus, then sometimes glasses will not be needed, and the strabismus control will remain the same. This is not always the case but most of the time does hold true.

But when a resident or early-career ophthalmologist has a complication, it can lead to a loss of confidence, worries and anxiety, and doubts about their career path. How can these new surgeons be reassured, reset their expectations, learn from their complications, and move forward? Lisa D. Kelly, MD, at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, mod&shy;erates a two-part roundtable discussion on possible solutions to this problem with Thomas A. Oetting, MD, at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and Rahul S. Tonk, MD, MBA, at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami. <em>(This discussion has been edited for length and clarity.) </em></p>\r\n<h2>Data on Risk by Years of Practice</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>The academic community in ophthalmology has developed pretty good systems for teaching the skill of do&shy;ing cataract surgery. At my institution, our residents learn it through a system&shy;atic and safe process, and I&rsquo;m pleased to say our graduates enter the workforce as very competent cataract surgeons. However, I&rsquo;m not sure that we, as an academic community, are as diligent and systematic in our teaching of how to manage the process after a surgical complication, both for the patient&rsquo;s well-being and our own as physicians and surgeons. </em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(16)31161-7/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A paper titled &ldquo;New Surgeon Out&shy;comes and the Effectiveness of Surgical Training&rdquo;</a> reported a higher rate of com plications among cataract surgeons who are in the early years of their career.</em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em>What do you think are the most important takeaways from that popula&shy;tion-based study? </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>I think that the Campbell study was an eye-opener for most of us in medical education, and surgical edu&shy;cation in particular. The study looked at cataract surgery performed in Ontario, Canada, between 1997 and 2013. The authors used multiple public health databases to look at something like 1.4 million eyes that had undergone cataract surgery. They assessed these eyes for the incidence of complications, including posterior capsular rupture, dropped lens fragments, retinal detach&shy;ment, and endophthalmitis, and strati&shy;fied these complications across years of practice following training.</p>\r\n<p>In comparing surgeons in their first year out from residency and those who were 10 years out, the authors found that surgeons in their first year of in&shy;dependent practice were 9 times more likely to have high complication rates (&ge;2%). The authors also found that, for each successive year of independent practice, there was a 10% risk reduction in the rate of adverse outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>So, only about half of surgeons in their first few years out of training had a complication rate of less than 1%. By the fifth year, that was 75% of surgeons, and by the ninth or 10th year, it was nearly 100%.</p>\r\n<p>This study has many implications for us as teachers. How do we make sure that our residents are clinically trained, and how do we balance their develop&shy;ment as future leaders and researchers against their raw surgical and technical training so that they can go out and perform surgeries at a high level? And we need to do this with a conscious&shy;ness toward increasing the supply of surgical ophthalmologists, particularly in under served communities.</p>\r\n<table style=\"max-width: 400px; margin: 35px auto 30px auto;\" border=\"0\" summary=\"Table Summary\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"https://d31g6oeq0bzej7.cloudfront.net/Assets/image/webp/0d1b5b4a-0882-4f5a-9454-7ec495824884.webp\" title=\"Converting to ECCE\" alt=\"Video still from cataract surgery with a &ldquo;play&rdquo; button overlaid.\" class=\"img-fluid\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 10px 0px 10px;\"><strong>CONVERTING TO ECCE.</strong> In this video from AAO 2023, Dr. Oetting discusses conversion to extracapsular cataract extraction and shares pearls (<a href=\"/education/annual-meeting-video/top-5-pearls-converting-to-extracapsularcataract-\">aao.org/education/annual-meeting-video/top-5-pearls-converting-to-extracapsularcataract-</a>).</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Identifying Trainees Who Need More Attention</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>I think that sets an excellent backdrop for our discussion today. Has any of that information influenced or informed your approach to teaching?</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>The educator needs to identify and intervene early when there is a question of surgical skill.</p>\r\n<p>There are certain trainees who are ahead of the curve in the operating room: they have raw talent, they have an interest in surgical development, and they&rsquo;re self-motivated. They spend time in the wet lab after hours, and they&rsquo;re watching surgical videos and taking courses at major meetings. Those sur&shy;geons tend to take well to feedback.</p>\r\n<p>And because they tend to develop at a higher rate, they get more surgical volume. Their staffers trust them more to work through surgical challenges or complications. So, the gap grows even wider between them and the other residents from the beginning to the end of residency.</p>\r\n<p>This is a very real issue for us. I think that the best thing I can do as an educator is identify early on those trainees who need extra attention in skill development, whether it&rsquo;s in confidence build&shy;ing or in technical facility. And I tell them, not in a harsh or negative way, where they fall along a bell curve of trainees with respect to surgical skill.</p>\r\n<p>If I can identify that early in their training, they will have plenty of time over the course of their residency for us to work together to develop their skills. On the other hand, if we only find out about surgical deficiencies in their senior year, we may run short on time. Then, they may default to additional training (as in a fellowship), or they&rsquo;re out in the real world. So, my key change as a result of this study is to start early to work with those trainees who need more intensive development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>That paper, as Rahul so beautifully summarized it, is powerful because it reminds us, as educators, that there&rsquo;s so much more going on af&shy;ter residency. We might forget about it, partially because when they go out into the world, we think it&rsquo;s not our problem anymore. But, of course, it&rsquo;s up to us to prepare them for the real world.</p>\r\n<h2>Watch Your Language</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>Tom, related to that, over the course of your career, you have taught many residents to do cataract surgery, and you also teach practicing surgeons on various platforms. How would you coach a new ophthalmologist who is in the middle of a cataract surgery and has an unforeseen complication? </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>One of the striking things when we&rsquo;re having a problem is that we sometimes forget that the patient is usually under topical anes&shy;thesia and can hear everything. There&rsquo;s a tendency for the surgeon to withdraw from the overall situation and think only about the eyeball. So, you some&shy;times use language that might create anxiety in the room; you might not convey confidence to the patient who&rsquo;s under the drape. I remember one case when the chamber became suddenly shallow, and I was talking with our resi&shy;dent about the possible causes. We were wondering out loud if it was a choroi&shy;dal hemorrhage, effusion, or possibly malignant glaucoma?</p>\r\n<p>The patient didn&rsquo;t say anything to me until about a month later, when he came into the room and said, &ldquo;Dr. Oetting, close the door.&rdquo; I said okay and closed the door. Then he said, &ldquo;When are you going to tell me about my malignancy?&rdquo; Ever since the surgery, he had been thinking about the fact that I had said the word &ldquo;malignant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Patients are hearing and thinking about everything you say and how you say it. I think it&rsquo;s important to have a &ldquo;script&rdquo; prepared for when problems occur, involving basic communication with the techs and nurses in the room; that way you don&rsquo;t have to say, &ldquo;Get me the &lsquo;everything went bad&rsquo; kit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Instead, you might say, very calmly, &ldquo;Get me the success kit&rdquo; (a term coined by Dr. Jerry Roper) or maybe &ldquo;Get me the vitrectomy kit.&rdquo; One of the cool things that a former faculty, Dr. Beth Repp, did was when she first came to Iowa was to set up these &ldquo;success kits&rdquo; for all the surgeons. One of them had everything you need to do an anterior vitrectomy, another had everything needed to convert to an extracapsular extraction, and so forth. Then when the surgeon asks for one of these kits, it&rsquo;s very simple communication, and every&shy;body understands what&rsquo;s going on.</p>\r\n<p>Another important point is to tell the patient what&rsquo;s happening during a complication because when they don&rsquo;t know they might assume something even worse. I think it&rsquo;s very reassuring to say something like, &ldquo;We had a prob&shy;lem with the capsule that supports your lens, but we have everything we need here to take care of it. It might take a few minutes, and you&rsquo;re going to hear some different sounds, but please just be confident that we&rsquo;re moving for&shy;ward.&rdquo; You can come up with your own quick script so you can say exactly what you mean to say when under pressure.</p>\r\n<h2>Recognize When the Mission Has Changed</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>The next step is to accept that you&rsquo;re not doing the same case as when you started: your goals have now changed. At the beginning, your goal was to take out the cataract and put in a toric lens, just right, in the right place. Now, suddenly, your mission is differ&shy;ent, and you have to accept that. Sur&shy;geons can get into trouble by clinging to the old mission instead of shifting into the mindset of the new mission.</p>\r\n<p>I learned a tip from Dr. Abhay Vasa&shy;vada, an amazing surgeon. He told me that when he has a complication&mdash;and believe me, it&rsquo;s something to hear that even he can have a complication&mdash;he stands up from the microscope and walks around the room a little bit to steady himself. Then he sits back down at the microscope and even adjusts the oculars as if he were a new surgeon, starting a new case. And he tells him&shy;self, &ldquo;I now have new goals and new objectives. I&rsquo;m going to come into the situation that I have now, and I&rsquo;m going to move forward.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s great advice for resetting yourself.</p>\r\n<h2>When Do You Take Over?</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>When a resident is in the mid&shy;dle of a complication, are there specific strategies to help that new surgeon to maintain or regain composure? </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>It&rsquo;s very common for me to take over for a while, as part of being a teacher, so it&rsquo;s not a big deal. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that something monumental has happened. I&rsquo;m weaving in and weaving out, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big failure, and it gives them time to regroup.</p>\r\n<p>It also depends on their level of training: if they&rsquo;re 20 cases in, they may not be ready to do the anterior vitrectomy. But if they&rsquo;re 300 cases in, then they&rsquo;re absolutely ready&mdash;they&rsquo;ve thought about it, and we have talked about it at some point before this case.</p>\r\n<p>One of the keys to being a teacher is knowing when to take over. When I first started teaching, I never took over. I thought I was supposed to ride in that airplane right into the mountain with the resident. All that accomplished was to lower the resident&rsquo;s surgical confi&shy;dence for six months or a year. I always say: &ldquo;Its better to do part of a good case than all of a bad case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Communication Doesn&rsquo;t Stop in the OR</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>When a complication has occurred, how do you mentor your res&shy;idents on how and when to communi&shy;cate with patients about the situation? </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>When you&rsquo;re done with the case&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care if you have 40 more cases that day&mdash;you go into the room with the family, you sit down and say something like, &ldquo;I want to tell you that we had a problem; some of the material from the cataract fell to the back of the eye, and we have to remove that material in a different way. It wasn&rsquo;t safe for me to do it myself with the equipment I know how to use, so I&rsquo;m going to get some help for us from some of my colleagues who do this work all the time, and we&rsquo;re going to move forward from here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I always say that I&rsquo;m sorry this happened, I&rsquo;m sorry that our plan has changed, I&rsquo;m sorry that it&rsquo;s going to take more time, but we&rsquo;re with you and we&rsquo;re going to take care of you. Then the next phase, which is probably the most important phase&mdash;and it&rsquo;s the healing phase for you, as the surgeon&mdash;is con&shy;tinuing to have a relationship with that patient. You do not push that patient away. You go 100% charging toward that patient. What I mean by that is that you give them your cell phone number, you text them, you call them, you check on their chart and see what&rsquo;s happen&shy;ing. If there&rsquo;s a note from the retina specialist, you can say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what he meant by that; it looks like everything&rsquo;s good. I work with this retina doctor a lot, and I&rsquo;m not worried at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>You are the guide through our con&shy;fusing medical system, and you are not abandoning this patient. I&rsquo;ve reviewed a lot of cases, and in the ones where people get sued, the most common complaint is that the doctor abandoned me, he didn&rsquo;t care about me. But this process of staying connected with the patient after the complication is also what heals you, the surgeon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>Of course, when there&rsquo;s a complication, first you must work through that situation and make sure, in that moment, that the patient is being well cared for. But before the patient leaves that day, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have some kind of conversation with either the patient or a family member.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes in the moments after an intense surgery, we forget to take off our surgeon&rsquo;s hat to explain the situ&shy;ation appropriately to the family. The adrenaline is high, and we end up being overly detailed, with lots of jargon. In&shy;stead, it&rsquo;s important to put ourselves in the mindset of the patient and family. When we say there was a complication, they&rsquo;re immediately thinking blindness&mdash;even though we as surgeons know that the rate of blindness from cataract surgery complications is quite low.</p>\r\n<p>So almost in the same breath as dis&shy;closing a complication, I tell them that I took care of the problem to the best of my ability, what their long-term prog&shy;nosis is, whether they&rsquo;ll need further surgery, and that I will be by their side throughout. Depending on the partic&shy;ulars of the case, I may say something like, &ldquo;I was able to get the cataract out and put a lens implant in, but there were some challenges. I think that, over time with my help, you&rsquo;re very likely to have a very good result.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Then, when you see them the next day for post-op follow-up, that&rsquo;s when you can explain more in detail. You&rsquo;ve had time to think about how to present this to the patient; and the patient has also had the opportunity to assess their pain level and see what amount of blur that they have.</p>\r\n<p>This appointment is a more struc&shy;tured time, and you&rsquo;ve got the white coat back on. That gives you a chance to have a real conversation. Then, as Tom does, I give my cell phone number to all patients who have had surgical compli&shy;cations. You want to hold these patients as close as possible, and just as Tom said, sometimes, it&rsquo;s those patients who had a complication that end up being your biggest supporters because of the way you managed it.</p>\r\n<h2>The Question of &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>The question of saying sorry might be a bit controversial. Some peo&shy;ple say it exposes you or admits fault. I take a different approach. In many of the mal practice cases I&rsquo;ve seen as an expert reviewer, it&rsquo;s often not a matter of financial compensation, but rather a matter of justice.</p>\r\n<p>Did the surgeon admit that some&shy;thing went wrong, and did they accept responsibility for it? I think you can head off so many problems with a simple apology, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the surgery didn&rsquo;t go as well as we had hoped. I know you&rsquo;re upset, and I am, too. I&rsquo;m going to make sure that I&rsquo;m with you throughout this period to regain as much vision as possible, and [if pos&shy;sible], get you to a point where you&rsquo;re better than you were before surgery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MORE ONLINE. </strong>For an AI-generated video for surgeons about healing from complications, go to <a href=\"bit.ly/surgical-complication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bit.ly/surgical-complication</a>.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________</span></p>\r\n<p>1 Campbell RJ et al. <em>Ophthalmology</em>. 2017;124(4):532-538.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Kelly </strong>is Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati and Taylor Asbury Professor of Ophthalmology, Medical Director of the University Eye Clinics, and Director of Medical Student Education in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. <em>Relevant financial disclo&shy;sures: None. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting </strong>is Clinical Professor and past Residency Program Director in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. <em>Relevant financial disclosures: None. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk </strong>is Associate Professor of Clinical Ophthalmology, Cornea Fellowship Co-Director, and Associate Medical Director at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami. <em>Relevant financial disclosures: None</em><em>. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>For full disclosures and the disclosure key,</strong>&nbsp;see below.</p>\r\n<table style=\"width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3>Full Financial Disclosures</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Kelly</strong> Federal Blue Cross Blue Shield: C.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Oetting</strong> None.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tonk </strong>Alcon C; Bausch + Lomb: C; Bruder: C; Johnson &amp; Johnson: L; Sight Sciences: C.</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"35%\">\r\n<h4>Disclosure&nbsp;Category</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"15%\">\r\n<h4>Code</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">\r\n<h4>Description</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Consultant/Advisor</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">C</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Consultant fee, paid advisory boards, or fees for attending a meeting.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Employee</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">E</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Hired to work for compensation or received a W2 from a company.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Employee, executive role</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">EE</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Hired to work in an executive role for compensation or received a W2 from a company.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Owner of company</td>\r\n<td>EO</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Ownership or controlling interest in a company, other than stock.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Independent contractor</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">I</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Contracted work, including contracted research.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Lecture fees/Speakers bureau</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">L</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Lecture fees or honoraria, travel fees or reimbursements when speaking at the invitation of a commercial company.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Patents/Royalty</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">P</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Beneficiary of patents and/or royalties for intellectual property.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Equity/Stock/Stock options holder, private corporation</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">PS</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Equity ownership, stock and/or stock options in privately owned firms, excluding mutual funds.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Grant support</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">S</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; valign: top;\">Grant support or other financial support from all sources, including research support from government agencies (e.g., NIH), foundations, device manufacturers, and\\or pharmaceutical companies.

<p>Experienced cataract surgeons recognize that complications can&rsquo;t always be avoided, even in the best hands. But when a resident or early-career ophthalmologist has a complication, it can lead to a loss of confidence, worries and anxiety, and doubts about their career path. How can these new surgeons be reassured, reset their expectations, learn from their complications, and move forward? Lisa D. Kelly, MD, at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, mod&shy;erates a two-part roundtable discussion on possible solutions to this problem with Thomas A. Oetting, MD, at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and Rahul S. Tonk, MD, MBA, at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami. <em>(This discussion has been edited for length and clarity.) </em></p>
<h2>Data on Risk by Years of Practice</h2>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>The academic community in ophthalmology has developed pretty good systems for teaching the skill of do&shy;ing cataract surgery. At my institution, our residents learn it through a system&shy;atic and safe process, and I&rsquo;m pleased to say our graduates enter the workforce as very competent cataract surgeons. However, I&rsquo;m not sure that we, as an academic community, are as diligent and systematic in our teaching of how to manage the process after a surgical complication, both for the patient&rsquo;s well-being and our own as physicians and surgeons. </em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(16)31161-7/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A paper titled &ldquo;New Surgeon Out&shy;comes and the Effectiveness of Surgical Training&rdquo;</a> reported a higher rate of com plications among cataract surgeons who are in the early years of their career.</em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em>What do you think are the most important takeaways from that popula&shy;tion-based study? </em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>I think that the Campbell study was an eye-opener for most of us in medical education, and surgical edu&shy;cation in particular. The study looked at cataract surgery performed in Ontario, Canada, between 1997 and 2013. The authors used multiple public health databases to look at something like 1.4 million eyes that had undergone cataract surgery. They assessed these eyes for the incidence of complications, including posterior capsular rupture, dropped lens fragments, retinal detach&shy;ment, and endophthalmitis, and strati&shy;fied these complications across years of practice following training.</p>
<p>In comparing surgeons in their first year out from residency and those who were 10 years out, the authors found that surgeons in their first year of in&shy;dependent practice were 9 times more likely to have high complication rates (&ge;2%). The authors also found that, for each successive year of independent practice, there was a 10% risk reduction in the rate of adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>So, only about half of surgeons in their first few years out of training had a complication rate of less than 1%. By the fifth year, that was 75% of surgeons, and by the ninth or 10th year, it was nearly 100%.</p>
<p>This study has many implications for us as teachers. How do we make sure that our residents are clinically trained, and how do we balance their develop&shy;ment as future leaders and researchers against their raw surgical and technical training so that they can go out and perform surgeries at a high level? And we need to do this with a conscious&shy;ness toward increasing the supply of surgical ophthalmologists, particularly in under served communities.</p>

<h2>Identifying Trainees Who Need More Attention</h2>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>I think that sets an excellent backdrop for our discussion today. Has any of that information influenced or informed your approach to teaching?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>The educator needs to identify and intervene early when there is a question of surgical skill.</p>
<p>There are certain trainees who are ahead of the curve in the operating room: they have raw talent, they have an interest in surgical development, and they&rsquo;re self-motivated. They spend time in the wet lab after hours, and they&rsquo;re watching surgical videos and taking courses at major meetings. Those sur&shy;geons tend to take well to feedback.</p>
<p>And because they tend to develop at a higher rate, they get more surgical volume. Their staffers trust them more to work through surgical challenges or complications. So, the gap grows even wider between them and the other residents from the beginning to the end of residency.</p>
<p>This is a very real issue for us. I think that the best thing I can do as an educator is identify early on those trainees who need extra attention in skill development, whether it&rsquo;s in confidence build&shy;ing or in technical facility. And I tell them, not in a harsh or negative way, where they fall along a bell curve of trainees with respect to surgical skill.</p>
<p>If I can identify that early in their training, they will have plenty of time over the course of their residency for us to work together to develop their skills. On the other hand, if we only find out about surgical deficiencies in their senior year, we may run short on time. Then, they may default to additional training (as in a fellowship), or they&rsquo;re out in the real world. So, my key change as a result of this study is to start early to work with those trainees who need more intensive development.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>That paper, as Rahul so beautifully summarized it, is powerful because it reminds us, as educators, that there&rsquo;s so much more going on af&shy;ter residency. We might forget about it, partially because when they go out into the world, we think it&rsquo;s not our problem anymore. But, of course, it&rsquo;s up to us to prepare them for the real world.</p>
<h2>Watch Your Language</h2>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>Tom, related to that, over the course of your career, you have taught many residents to do cataract surgery, and you also teach practicing surgeons on various platforms. How would you coach a new ophthalmologist who is in the middle of a cataract surgery and has an unforeseen complication? </em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>One of the striking things when we&rsquo;re having a problem is that we sometimes forget that the patient is usually under topical anes&shy;thesia and can hear everything. There&rsquo;s a tendency for the surgeon to withdraw from the overall situation and think only about the eyeball. So, you some&shy;times use language that might create anxiety in the room; you might not convey confidence to the patient who&rsquo;s under the drape. I remember one case when the chamber became suddenly shallow, and I was talking with our resi&shy;dent about the possible causes. We were wondering out loud if it was a choroi&shy;dal hemorrhage, effusion, or possibly malignant glaucoma?</p>
<p>The patient didn&rsquo;t say anything to me until about a month later, when he came into the room and said, &ldquo;Dr. Oetting, close the door.&rdquo; I said okay and closed the door. Then he said, &ldquo;When are you going to tell me about my malignancy?&rdquo; Ever since the surgery, he had been thinking about the fact that I had said the word &ldquo;malignant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patients are hearing and thinking about everything you say and how you say it. I think it&rsquo;s important to have a &ldquo;script&rdquo; prepared for when problems occur, involving basic communication with the techs and nurses in the room; that way you don&rsquo;t have to say, &ldquo;Get me the &lsquo;everything went bad&rsquo; kit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, you might say, very calmly, &ldquo;Get me the success kit&rdquo; (a term coined by Dr. Jerry Roper) or maybe &ldquo;Get me the vitrectomy kit.&rdquo; One of the cool things that a former faculty, Dr. Beth Repp, did was when she first came to Iowa was to set up these &ldquo;success kits&rdquo; for all the surgeons. One of them had everything you need to do an anterior vitrectomy, another had everything needed to convert to an extracapsular extraction, and so forth. Then when the surgeon asks for one of these kits, it&rsquo;s very simple communication, and every&shy;body understands what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Another important point is to tell the patient what&rsquo;s happening during a complication because when they don&rsquo;t know they might assume something even worse. I think it&rsquo;s very reassuring to say something like, &ldquo;We had a prob&shy;lem with the capsule that supports your lens, but we have everything we need here to take care of it. It might take a few minutes, and you&rsquo;re going to hear some different sounds, but please just be confident that we&rsquo;re moving for&shy;ward.&rdquo; You can come up with your own quick script so you can say exactly what you mean to say when under pressure.</p>
<h2>Recognize When the Mission Has Changed</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>The next step is to accept that you&rsquo;re not doing the same case as when you started: your goals have now changed. At the beginning, your goal was to take out the cataract and put in a toric lens, just right, in the right place. Now, suddenly, your mission is differ&shy;ent, and you have to accept that. Sur&shy;geons can get into trouble by clinging to the old mission instead of shifting into the mindset of the new mission.</p>
<p>I learned a tip from Dr. Abhay Vasa&shy;vada, an amazing surgeon. He told me that when he has a complication&mdash;and believe me, it&rsquo;s something to hear that even he can have a complication&mdash;he stands up from the microscope and walks around the room a little bit to steady himself. Then he sits back down at the microscope and even adjusts the oculars as if he were a new surgeon, starting a new case. And he tells him&shy;self, &ldquo;I now have new goals and new objectives. I&rsquo;m going to come into the situation that I have now, and I&rsquo;m going to move forward.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s great advice for resetting yourself.</p>
<h2>When Do You Take Over?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>When a resident is in the mid&shy;dle of a complication, are there specific strategies to help that new surgeon to maintain or regain composure? </em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>It&rsquo;s very common for me to take over for a while, as part of being a teacher, so it&rsquo;s not a big deal. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that something monumental has happened. I&rsquo;m weaving in and weaving out, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big failure, and it gives them time to regroup.</p>
<p>It also depends on their level of training: if they&rsquo;re 20 cases in, they may not be ready to do the anterior vitrectomy. But if they&rsquo;re 300 cases in, then they&rsquo;re absolutely ready&mdash;they&rsquo;ve thought about it, and we have talked about it at some point before this case.</p>
<p>One of the keys to being a teacher is knowing when to take over. When I first started teaching, I never took over. I thought I was supposed to ride in that airplane right into the mountain with the resident. All that accomplished was to lower the resident&rsquo;s surgical confi&shy;dence for six months or a year. I always say: &ldquo;Its better to do part of a good case than all of a bad case.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Communication Doesn&rsquo;t Stop in the OR</h2>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Kelly: </em></strong><em>When a complication has occurred, how do you mentor your res&shy;idents on how and when to communi&shy;cate with patients about the situation? </em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oetting: </strong>When you&rsquo;re done with the case&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care if you have 40 more cases that day&mdash;you go into the room with the family, you sit down and say something like, &ldquo;I want to tell you that we had a problem; some of the material from the cataract fell to the back of the eye, and we have to remove that material in a different way. It wasn&rsquo;t safe for me to do it myself with the equipment I know how to use, so I&rsquo;m going to get some help for us from some of my colleagues who do this work all the time, and we&rsquo;re going to move forward from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I always say that I&rsquo;m sorry this happened, I&rsquo;m sorry that our plan has changed, I&rsquo;m sorry that it&rsquo;s going to take more time, but we&rsquo;re with you and we&rsquo;re going to take care of you. Then the next phase, which is probably the most important phase&mdash;and it&rsquo;s the healing phase for you, as the surgeon&mdash;is con&shy;tinuing to have a relationship with that patient. You do not push that patient away. You go 100% charging toward that patient. What I mean by that is that you give them your cell phone number, you text them, you call them, you check on their chart and see what&rsquo;s happen&shy;ing. If there&rsquo;s a note from the retina specialist, you can say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what he meant by that; it looks like everything&rsquo;s good. I work with this retina doctor a lot, and I&rsquo;m not worried at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are the guide through our con&shy;fusing medical system, and you are not abandoning this patient. I&rsquo;ve reviewed a lot of cases, and in the ones where people get sued, the most common complaint is that the doctor abandoned me, he didn&rsquo;t care about me. But this process of staying connected with the patient after the complication is also what heals you, the surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>Of course, when there&rsquo;s a complication, first you must work through that situation and make sure, in that moment, that the patient is being well cared for. But before the patient leaves that day, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have some kind of conversation with either the patient or a family member.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the moments after an intense surgery, we forget to take off our surgeon&rsquo;s hat to explain the situ&shy;ation appropriately to the family. The adrenaline is high, and we end up being overly detailed, with lots of jargon. In&shy;stead, it&rsquo;s important to put ourselves in the mindset of the patient and family. When we say there was a complication, they&rsquo;re immediately thinking blindness&mdash;even though we as surgeons know that the rate of blindness from cataract surgery complications is quite low.</p>
<p>So almost in the same breath as dis&shy;closing a complication, I tell them that I took care of the problem to the best of my ability, what their long-term prog&shy;nosis is, whether they&rsquo;ll need further surgery, and that I will be by their side throughout. Depending on the partic&shy;ulars of the case, I may say something like, &ldquo;I was able to get the cataract out and put a lens implant in, but there were some challenges. I think that, over time with my help, you&rsquo;re very likely to have a very good result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when you see them the next day for post-op follow-up, that&rsquo;s when you can explain more in detail. You&rsquo;ve had time to think about how to present this to the patient; and the patient has also had the opportunity to assess their pain level and see what amount of blur that they have.</p>
<p>This appointment is a more struc&shy;tured time, and you&rsquo;ve got the white coat back on. That gives you a chance to have a real conversation. Then, as Tom does, I give my cell phone number to all patients who have had surgical compli&shy;cations. You want to hold these patients as close as possible, and just as Tom said, sometimes, it&rsquo;s those patients who had a complication that end up being your biggest supporters because of the way you managed it.</p>
<h2>The Question of &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Tonk: </strong>The question of saying sorry might be a bit controversial. Some peo&shy;ple say it exposes you or admits fault. I take a different approach. In many of the mal practice cases I&rsquo;ve seen as an expert reviewer, it&rsquo;s often not a matter of financial compensation, but rather a matter of justice.</p>
<p>Did the surgeon admit that some&shy;thing went wrong, and did they accept responsibility for it? I think you can head off so many problems with a simple apology, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the surgery didn&rsquo;t go as well as we had hoped. I know you&rsquo;re upset, and I am, too. I&rsquo;m going to make sure that I&rsquo;m with you throughout this period to regain as much vision as possible, and [if pos&shy;sible], get you to a point where you&rsquo;re better than you were before surgery.&rdquo;</p>

A protective shield may be placed over your eye to keep it safe as it heals. Your doctor may advise you to wear the covering for several nights while you sleep. Avoid touching or rubbing your eye.\n\nYour eye heals in two stages, Dr. Hovanesian says. During the first 24 hours, the small incision begins to close and the surface of the eye seals shut. But the smooth barrier underneath the eye's surface can take another few weeks to fully heal. Your ophthalmologist will prescribe antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection and anti-inflammatory eye drops to help reduce any internal swelling.\n\n“Expectations after cataract surgery are high, and patients often wonder why they don’t have 20/20 vision in the days or even weeks after their procedure,” says ophthalmologist and Academy member John Hovanesian, MD, a specialist in cataract and corneal surgery. “That’s like having a hip replacement surgery and asking why you can’t run a marathon at your usual speed the next day. It takes time, physical therapy and patience before you regain all your abilities.

At my institution, our residents learn it through a system­atic and safe process, and I’m pleased to say our graduates enter the workforce as very competent cataract surgeons. However, I’m not sure that we, as an academic community, are as diligent and systematic in our teaching of how to manage the process after a surgical complication, both for the patient’s well-being and our own as physicians and surgeons.\n\nA paper titled “New Surgeon Out­comes and the Effectiveness of Surgical Training” reported a higher rate of com plications among cataract surgeons who are in the early years of their career. 1 What do you think are the most important takeaways from that popula­tion-based study?\n\nDr. Tonk: I think that the Campbell study was an eye-opener for most of us in medical education, and surgical edu­cation in particular. The study looked at cataract surgery performed in Ontario, Canada, between 1997 and 2013. The authors used multiple public health databases to look at something like 1.4 million eyes that had undergone cataract surgery. They assessed these eyes for the incidence of complications, including posterior capsular rupture, dropped lens fragments, retinal detach­ment, and endophthalmitis, and strati­fied these complications across years of practice following training.\n\nIn comparing surgeons in their first year out from residency and those who were 10 years out, the authors found that surgeons in their first year of in­dependent practice were 9 times more likely to have high complication rates (≥2%). The authors also found that, for each successive year of independent practice, there was a 10% risk reduction in the rate of adverse outcomes.\n\nSo, only about half of surgeons in their first few years out of training had a complication rate of less than 1%. By the fifth year, that was 75% of surgeons, and by the ninth or 10th year, it was nearly 100%.\n\nThis study has many implications for us as teachers. How do we make sure that our residents are clinically trained, and how do we balance their develop­ment as future leaders and researchers against their raw surgical and technical training so that they can go out and perform surgeries at a high level? And we need to do this with a conscious­ness toward increasing the supply of surgical ophthalmologists, particularly in under served communities.", "links": [{"text": "A paper titled “New Surgeon Out­comes and the Effectiveness of Surgical Training”", "url": "https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(16)31161-7/abstract"}, {"text": "aao.org/education/annual-meeting-video/top-5-pearls-converting-to-extracapsularcataract-", "url": "https://www.aao.org/education/annual-meeting-video/top-5-pearls-converting-to-extracapsularcataract-"}], "media": [{"type": "image", "url": "https://d31g6oeq0bzej7.cloudfront.net/Assets/image/webp/0d1b5b4a-0882-4f5a-9454-7ec495824884.webp", "alt": "Video still from cataract surgery with a “play” button overlaid.", "caption": null}], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-cataract-surgery-complications.html"}

Has any of that information influenced or informed your approach to teaching?\n\nDr. Tonk: The educator needs to identify and intervene early when there is a question of surgical skill.\n\nThere are certain trainees who are ahead of the curve in the operating room: they have raw talent, they have an interest in surgical development, and they’re self-motivated. They spend time in the wet lab after hours, and they’re watching surgical videos and taking courses at major meetings. Those sur­geons tend to take well to feedback.\n\nAnd because they tend to develop at a higher rate, they get more surgical volume. Their staffers trust them more to work through surgical challenges or complications. So, the gap grows even wider between them and the other residents from the beginning to the end of residency.\n\nThis is a very real issue for us. I think that the best thing I can do as an educator is identify early on those trainees who need extra attention in skill development, whether it’s in confidence build­ing or in technical facility. And I tell them, not in a harsh or negative way, where they fall along a bell curve of trainees with respect to surgical skill.\n\nIf I can identify that early in their training, they will have plenty of time over the course of their residency for us to work together to develop their skills. On the other hand, if we only find out about surgical deficiencies in their senior year, we may run short on time. Then, they may default to additional training (as in a fellowship), or they’re out in the real world. So, my key change as a result of this study is to start early to work with those trainees who need more intensive development.\n\nDr. Oetting: That paper, as Rahul so beautifully summarized it, is powerful because it reminds us, as educators, that there’s so much more going on af­ter residency. We might forget about it, partially because when they go out into the world, we think it’s not our problem anymore. But, of course, it’s up to us to prepare them for the real world.", "links": [], "media": [], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-cataract-surgery-complications.html"}

How would you coach a new ophthalmologist who is in the middle of a cataract surgery and has an unforeseen complication?\n\nDr. Oetting: One of the striking things when we’re having a problem is that we sometimes forget that the patient is usually under topical anes­thesia and can hear everything. There’s a tendency for the surgeon to withdraw from the overall situation and think only about the eyeball. So, you some­times use language that might create anxiety in the room; you might not convey confidence to the patient who’s under the drape. I remember one case when the chamber became suddenly shallow, and I was talking with our resi­dent about the possible causes. We were wondering out loud if it was a choroi­dal hemorrhage, effusion, or possibly malignant glaucoma?\n\nThe patient didn’t say anything to me until about a month later, when he came into the room and said, “Dr. Oetting, close the door.” I said okay and closed the door. Then he said, “When are you going to tell me about my malignancy?” Ever since the surgery, he had been thinking about the fact that I had said the word “malignant.”\n\nPatients are hearing and thinking about everything you say and how you say it. I think it’s important to have a “script” prepared for when problems occur, involving basic communication with the techs and nurses in the room; that way you don’t have to say, “Get me the ‘everything went bad’ kit.”\n\nInstead, you might say, very calmly, “Get me the success kit” (a term coined by Dr. Jerry Roper) or maybe “Get me the vitrectomy kit.” One of the cool things that a former faculty, Dr. Beth Repp, did was when she first came to Iowa was to set up these “success kits” for all the surgeons. One of them had everything you need to do an anterior vitrectomy, another had everything needed to convert to an extracapsular extraction, and so forth. Then when the surgeon asks for one of these kits, it’s very simple communication, and every­body understands what’s going on.\n\nAnother important point is to tell the patient what’s happening during a complication because when they don’t know they might assume something even worse. I think it’s very reassuring to say something like, “We had a prob­lem with the capsule that supports your lens, but we have everything we need here to take care of it. It might take a few minutes, and you’re going to hear some different sounds, but please just be confident that we’re moving for­ward.” You can come up with your own quick script so you can say exactly what you mean to say when under pressure.", "links": [], "media": [], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-cataract-surgery-complications.html"}

Sur­geons can get into trouble by clinging to the old mission instead of shifting into the mindset of the new mission.\n\nI learned a tip from Dr. Abhay Vasa­vada, an amazing surgeon. He told me that when he has a complication—and believe me, it’s something to hear that even he can have a complication—he stands up from the microscope and walks around the room a little bit to steady himself. Then he sits back down at the microscope and even adjusts the oculars as if he were a new surgeon, starting a new case. And he tells him­self, “I now have new goals and new objectives. I’m going to come into the situation that I have now, and I’m going to move forward.” I think that’s great advice for resetting yourself.", "links": [], "media": [], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-cataract-surgery-complications.html"}

It doesn’t mean that something monumental has happened. I’m weaving in and weaving out, so it doesn’t seem like a big failure, and it gives them time to regroup.\n\nIt also depends on their level of training: if they’re 20 cases in, they may not be ready to do the anterior vitrectomy. But if they’re 300 cases in, then they’re absolutely ready—they’ve thought about it, and we have talked about it at some point before this case.\n\nOne of the keys to being a teacher is knowing when to take over. When I first started teaching, I never took over. I thought I was supposed to ride in that airplane right into the mountain with the resident. All that accomplished was to lower the resident’s surgical confi­dence for six months or a year.

It wasn’t safe for me to do it myself with the equipment I know how to use, so I’m going to get some help for us from some of my colleagues who do this work all the time, and we’re going to move forward from here.”\n\nI always say that I’m sorry this happened, I’m sorry that our plan has changed, I’m sorry that it’s going to take more time, but we’re with you and we’re going to take care of you. Then the next phase, which is probably the most important phase—and it’s the healing phase for you, as the surgeon—is con­tinuing to have a relationship with that patient. You do not push that patient away. You go 100% charging toward that patient. What I mean by that is that you give them your cell phone number, you text them, you call them, you check on their chart and see what’s happen­ing. If there’s a note from the retina specialist, you can say, “Here’s what he meant by that; it looks like everything’s good. I work with this retina doctor a lot, and I’m not worried at all.”\n\nYou are the guide through our con­fusing medical system, and you are not abandoning this patient. I’ve reviewed a lot of cases, and in the ones where people get sued, the most common complaint is that the doctor abandoned me, he didn’t care about me. But this process of staying connected with the patient after the complication is also what heals you, the surgeon.\n\nDr. Tonk: Of course, when there’s a complication, first you must work through that situation and make sure, in that moment, that the patient is being well cared for. But before the patient leaves that day, it’s a good idea to have some kind of conversation with either the patient or a family member.\n\nSometimes in the moments after an intense surgery, we forget to take off our surgeon’s hat to explain the situ­ation appropriately to the family. The adrenaline is high, and we end up being overly detailed, with lots of jargon. In­stead, it’s important to put ourselves in the mindset of the patient and family. When we say there was a complication, they’re immediately thinking blindness—even though we as surgeons know that the rate of blindness from cataract surgery complications is quite low.\n\nSo almost in the same breath as dis­closing a complication, I tell them that I took care of the problem to the best of my ability, what their long-term prog­nosis is, whether they’ll need further surgery, and that I will be by their side throughout. Depending on the partic­ulars of the case, I may say something like, “I was able to get the cataract out and put a lens implant in, but there were some challenges. I think that, over time with my help, you’re very likely to have a very good result.”\n\nThen, when you see them the next day for post-op follow-up, that’s when you can explain more in detail. You’ve had time to think about how to present this to the patient; and the patient has also had the opportunity to assess their pain level and see what amount of blur that they have.\n\nThis appointment is a more struc­tured time, and you’ve got the white coat back on. That gives you a chance to have a real conversation. Then, as Tom does, I give my cell phone number to all patients who have had surgical compli­cations. You want to hold these patients as close as possible, and just as Tom said, sometimes, it’s those patients who had a complication that end up being your biggest supporters because of the way you managed it.", "links": [], "media": [], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-cataract-surgery-complications.html"}

It helps you see clearly if your vision becomes cloudy again.\n\nWhen you have cataract surgery, your ophthalmologist removes your eye's cloudy lens . They replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) . The IOL is held in place in the eye’s natural lens capsule . Weeks, months or years later, this capsule can become cloudy or wrinkled, causing blurry vision. This is called a posterior capsule opacification (PCO). It’s also sometimes called a \"secondary cataract\" or \"scar tissue.\" With posterior capsulotomy, a laser is used to make an opening in the cloudy capsule. This allows light to pass through again for clear vision.

There are many different causes and subtypes of OSD. Symptoms include red, watery, irritated and itchy eyes and fluctuating blurry vision.\n\n- A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of the eye that leads to a decrease in vision. If you have a cataract, you may see faded colors, have blurry vision, glare and trouble with bright and/or seeing at night.\n\n“There’s an overlap in cataract and ocular surface disease symptoms: blurry vision,” said Academy member Christopher Starr, MD, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medical Center. “Cataract patients who experience intermittent blurriness or other fluctuations in their vision throughout the day often assume this is related to their cataract, when in fact the culprit is often untreated ocular surface disease.”\n\nBoth eye conditions become more common with age, and studies suggest that anywhere between 50% to 75% of those with cataracts also have dry eye disease or another type of OSD. While cataracts are more regularly diagnosed, OSD often goes undetected.\n\nIt’s important to treat ocular surface disease before proceeding with cataract surgery.

Comprised of your cornea and tear film , the ocular surface supplies two thirds of the optical power in your eye, according to Dr. Starr. The last third comes from your lens, which is the part that gets replaced during cataract surgery.\n\n- Ocular surface disease can affect calculations for the IOL that will replace your natural lens during cataract surgery. Your surgeon measures your eye to determine the proper focusing power for your IOL. If your tear film is irregular, your ocular surface dry or your vision fluctuates due to OSD, that can lead to data errors during the measurement process. These errors can result in an IOL that may not be ideal for your eyes. You may be left with some residual far sightedness, near sightedness or astigmatism after surgery.\n\n- Cataract surgery can often temporarily worsen OSD or lead to a dry eye flare . The incisions made during surgery can upset the balance of your tear film and ocular surface homeostasis. Eye drops used pre- and post-operatively—including topical anesthetic, steroid and antibiotic drops—often contain preservatives that are likely to irritate your ocular surface. Exposure to irrigation, drying and light from the operating microscope during surgery can cause some damage to the corneal and conjunctival surface, aggravating OSD symptoms. Even if OSD is mild before surgery, worsening symptoms can last for several months afterward, negatively affecting your vision.\n\n- Some forms of OSD are contagious and, if left untreated, can increase the risk of an infection after cataract surgery. Bacterial conjunctivitis and some forms of anterior blepharitis are common causes of OSD where active bacteria may be present on the eyelid margin. If this bacteria gets into the eye during surgery, it can lead to a serious and vision-threatening infection.", "links": [{"text": "cornea", "url": "https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/cornea-103"}, {"text": "tear film", "url": "https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/tear-film-3"}, {"text": "dry eye flare", "url": "https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/treatment-symptom-relieve-dry-eye-flare"}], "media": [], "language": "en", "html_path": "data\\raw\\html\\articles\\aao-dry-eye-cataract-surgery.html"}

This screening may include questionnaires, a thorough ocular surface exam and, in some cases, special testing such as:\n\n- Tearlab Osmolarity System: This tool can determine if you have dry eye disease and how severe it is.\n\n- InflammaDry: This test detects an inflammatory molecule that is often elevated in the tears of patients with various ocular surface diseases.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with an OSD, you’ll want to treat it as quickly as possible to be able to proceed with your cataract surgery. However, finding the right solution may involve some trial and error. Many people need to combine therapies and make a few lifestyle changes. Depending on the severity and sub-type of your OSD, you may need to delay your cataract surgery to get your ocular surface disease under control first.\n\nTo treat OSD your doctor may prescribe:\n\n- Topical medications or pills that prevent inflammation and infection\n\n- FDA-approved drugs such as Restasis, Xiidra, Cequa or Eyesuvis\n\n- Devices such as LipiFlow, TearCare, Blephex and/or specialty contact lenses\n\n- Punctal plugs\n\nYou may need to start one or more of these treatments prior to surgery for a pre-emptive strike.

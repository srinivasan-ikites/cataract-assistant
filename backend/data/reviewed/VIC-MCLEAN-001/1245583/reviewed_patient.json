Specifically, in your right eye, you have **1-2+ nuclear sclerosis** and **2+ cortical cataract**, and in your left eye, you have **1+ cortical** and **1-2+ nuclear sclerosis cataract**. These are common types of **cataracts** where the natural lens inside your eye becomes cloudy, making your vision blurry, causing glare, and making it harder to see, especially at night. We also noted that you have **astigmatism** in your right eye, which means your eye is shaped a bit like a football instead of a basketball, causing blurry vision at all distances.",
      "details": [
        "Your **cataracts** are causing your natural eye lens to become cloudy, which is why you might be experiencing blurry vision, difficulty with night driving, and glare.",
        "The **nuclear sclerosis** means the center of your lens is hardening and yellowing, while the **cortical cataract** means cloudiness is developing around the edges of your lens.",

          "answer": "A **cataract** is when the clear lens inside your eye becomes cloudy. It's a very common condition, especially as we get older, and it's not a growth on your eye, but rather a change within the lens itself."

        {
          "question": "What is **nuclear sclerosis** and **cortical cataract**?",
          "answer": "**Nuclear sclerosis** refers to the hardening and yellowing of the central part of your eye's lens. **Cortical cataracts** are cloudiness that forms around the edges of the lens, like spokes on a wheel. Both types can make your vision blurry and cause glare."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do I have **cataracts**?",
          "answer": "**Cataracts** are a natural part of aging for most people. Over time, the proteins in your eye's lens can break down and clump together, causing cloudiness. Other factors like genetics, certain medical conditions, or past eye injuries can also play a role."

          "question": "How is **cataract surgery** performed?",
          "answer": "**Cataract surgery** is typically performed using a technique called **phacoemulsification**. This involves making a tiny incision, then using ultrasound waves to break up the cloudy lens into small pieces, which are then gently suctioned out. Finally, a new **IOL** is inserted."

        {
          "question": "Is **cataract surgery** painful?",

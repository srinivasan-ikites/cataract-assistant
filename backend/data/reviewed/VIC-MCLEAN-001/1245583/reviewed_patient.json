      "summary": "Hello Lata, thank you for trusting us with your care. Based on our examinations, you have **Senile Cataracts** in both eyes. Specifically, in your right eye, you have **nuclear sclerosis (1-2+)** and **cortical cataracts (2+)**, and in your left eye, you have **cortical cataracts (1+)** and **nuclear sclerosis (1-2+)**. This means the natural lenses inside your eyes are becoming cloudy, which is a very common part of aging. These cloudy areas are what we call **cataracts**, and they are causing your vision to become blurry, making things like reading and even driving at night more difficult, and contributing to the **glare** and **halos** you've been experiencing. We also noted you have **Dry Eye Syndrome** and **Myopia**, which we'll keep in mind as we plan your treatment.",

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What exactly are **cataracts**?",
          "answer": "**Cataracts** are a clouding of the natural lens inside your eye. Think of your eye's lens like a camera lens; normally it's clear, but with **cataracts**, it becomes foggy, making your vision blurry, dull, or hazy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is **nuclear sclerosis** and **cortical cataracts**?",
          "answer": "These are just different types of **cataracts** based on where the cloudiness forms in your lens. **Nuclear sclerosis** means the center of your lens is hardening and turning yellow or brown, while **cortical cataracts** are wedge-shaped cloudy areas that form around the edge of your lens, like spokes on a wheel. Both can affect your vision in different ways, but the solution is the same: **cataract surgery**."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do **cataracts** affect my daily life, like my hobbies of reading and walking?",
          "answer": "As your **cataracts** progress, you might find that reading becomes harder, even with good lighting, because the words appear blurry or faded. Walking might feel less secure if your vision isn't as sharp, especially in dim light or unfamiliar places. The **glare** and **halos** you've noticed can also make outdoor activities or looking at bright lights uncomfortable."

This will directly address your **nuclear sclerosis** and **cortical cataracts**, helping you see the world more clearly again, making activities like reading and driving much easier and reducing that bothersome **glare**.",

It's designed to stay in your eye permanently and help you see clearly. For you, Lata, based on our current assessment and your candidacy profile, a **Monofocal IOL** is likely the most suitable option. This type of lens is designed to give you clear vision at one specific distance, usually far away, which aligns with your goal of good **distance vision**. We'll discuss how this might affect your need for reading glasses, especially considering your love for reading.",

Given your candidacy profile, a **Monofocal IOL** is our primary recommendation. This lens is excellent for clear **distance vision**, which is your main goal, but you would still need reading glasses for close-up activities like reading or looking at music scores. We also need to consider the **astigmatism** in your right eye. While your candidacy profile currently suggests a **Monofocal IOL**, we have noted a discrepancy in the **astigmatism** measurements for your right eye (IOLMaster shows -2.72D, Pentacam shows 1.7D). This means we'll need to discuss this further to determine if a **Monofocal Toric IOL**, which corrects **astigmatism**, might be beneficial for that eye to give you even sharper **distance vision** without glasses. **Multifocal IOLs**, which aim to provide vision at multiple distances, are not currently recommended for you based on our assessment.",

          "question": "What's the main difference between a **Monofocal IOL** and a **Toric IOL**?",
          "answer": "A **Monofocal IOL** corrects vision for one distance (usually far away). A **Toric IOL** is a special type of **Monofocal IOL** that also corrects **astigmatism**, which is an imperfection in the curvature of your eye that causes blurry or distorted vision at all distances. If you have significant **astigmatism**, a **Toric IOL** can provide even sharper **distance vision** without glasses."

          "answer": "Yes, with a **Monofocal IOL** set for **distance vision**, you will most likely need reading glasses for close-up tasks like reading, knitting, or using your phone. You might also need glasses for intermediate vision, like seeing your computer screen clearly."

Based on your specific eye health and measurements, they are not the best option to achieve your visual goals and might introduce unwanted visual side effects like **glare** or **halos**, which you already experience."

    "my diagnosis": {
      "title": "My Diagnosis",
      "summary": "You have **Combined form of senile cataract**, specifically **Nuclear sclerosis and cortical** cataracts in both eyes, Lata. This means the natural lenses in your eyes have become cloudy, making it harder to see clearly. You've mentioned experiencing **blurred vision**, **glare from headlights**, and **difficulty driving at night**, which are all very common symptoms of **cataracts**. We also noted that your right eye has significant **astigmatism** (2.72D), which is a common vision condition where your eye isn't perfectly round, causing blurry or distorted vision at all distances.",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What exactly is a **cataract**?",
          "answer": "A **cataract** is when the clear lens inside your eye becomes cloudy, much like looking through a foggy window. This cloudiness can make your vision blurry, colors seem dull, and cause glare from lights."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is **Nuclear sclerosis**?",
          "answer": "**Nuclear sclerosis** is a type of **cataract** where the center of your eye's lens, called the nucleus, gradually hardens and yellows. This often leads to a progressive blurring of distance vision and can sometimes even temporarily improve near vision."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a **cortical cataract**?",
          "answer": "A **cortical cataract** affects the outer edge of your eye's lens, forming wedge-shaped opacities that point towards the center. These can cause glare, especially at night, and make your vision hazy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is **astigmatism**?",
          "answer": "**Astigmatism** is a common vision condition where the front surface of your eye, the cornea, or the lens inside your eye, has an irregular curve. Instead of being perfectly round like a basketball, it's shaped more like a football. This causes light to focus unevenly on your retina, leading to blurry or distorted vision at all distances."

During the surgery, your doctor will gently remove the cloudy natural lens in your eye, which is causing your **Nuclear sclerosis and cortical** cataracts, and replace it with a new, clear artificial lens called an **Intraocular Lens**, or **IOL**. This will help you see the world clearly again!",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How long does **cataract surgery** take?",

        {
          "question": "Is **cataract surgery** painful?",

        {
          "question": "What kind of anesthesia is used for **cataract surgery**?",
          "answer": "We typically use a local anesthetic, which means your eye will be numbed with drops or an injection around the eye. You'll be awake but very relaxed, and you won't see what's happening during the surgery."

This means you'll likely be able to enjoy activities like reading, walking, and watching TV with much less reliance on glasses. While a standard **Monofocal IOL** would give you clear distance vision (but you'd still need glasses for reading and intermediate tasks), and a **Monofocal Toric IOL** would correct your **astigmatism** for distance vision, your chosen **Trifocal IOL** offers the most comprehensive vision correction, aiming for excellent vision across all ranges.",

It's about achieving the best possible vision without constant reliance on glasses."

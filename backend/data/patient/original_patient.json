      "title": "My Diagnosis",
      "summary": "Hello Lata, let's talk about your eyes. You have **Nuclear Sclerosis**. This means the natural lens inside your eye has become cloudy and hardened over time. It's a very common type of **cataract** that develops as we get older. This cloudiness can make your vision blurry, colors appear dull or faded, and you might find it harder to see clearly, especially at night or in bright lights. It's why you might be noticing things aren't as sharp as they used to be.",

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What exactly is **Nuclear Sclerosis**?",
          "answer": "**Nuclear Sclerosis** is a type of **cataract** where the central part of your eye's natural lens, called the nucleus, gradually hardens and turns yellowish or brownish. This change causes the lens to become less transparent, leading to blurry vision and changes in how you perceive colors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is **Nuclear Sclerosis** serious?",
          "answer": "While it's not immediately dangerous, **Nuclear Sclerosis** will continue to progress and make your vision worse over time. It can significantly impact your daily activities, like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The good news is that it's very treatable with **cataract surgery**."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I prevent **Nuclear Sclerosis** from getting worse?",
          "answer": "Unfortunately, there's no proven way to prevent **cataracts** like **Nuclear Sclerosis** from developing or progressing once they start, as they are a natural part of aging. However, protecting your eyes from UV light with sunglasses and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be beneficial for overall eye health."

It's where we gently remove your cloudy natural lens, which has **Nuclear Sclerosis**, and replace it with a clear, artificial lens called an **Intraocular Lens** or **IOL**. It's a quick procedure, usually taking only about 15-20 minutes per eye, and most people experience a wonderful improvement in their vision.",

A tiny incision is made in your eye, and a small instrument uses ultrasound waves to gently break up the cloudy lens (your **cataract**) into tiny pieces, which are then suctioned out. After that, a new, clear artificial lens (**IOL**) is carefully inserted."

We also have other options like **Toric IOLs** if you have **astigmatism**, which can correct that blurriness, and **Multifocal IOLs** or **Extended Depth of Focus IOLs** that can provide a wider range of vision, potentially reducing your need for glasses at multiple distances.

          "answer": "The main difference is the range of vision they provide. A **Monofocal IOL** gives you clear vision at one distance (usually far away), so you'll likely need glasses for other distances. **Toric IOLs** correct **astigmatism** in addition to distance vision. **Multifocal IOLs** or **Extended Depth of Focus IOLs** are designed to give you a broader range of vision, reducing your dependence on glasses for both near and far, but they may have some trade-offs like halos around lights."

          "question": "Why might a **Monofocal IOL** be a good choice for me?",
          "answer": "A **Monofocal IOL** is an excellent choice for restoring clear, sharp vision, especially for distance. It's a reliable and widely used option that provides predictable results.

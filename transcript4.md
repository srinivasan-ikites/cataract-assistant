00:00:00
 
geet: Hi, Dr. Alani.
Srinivasan H: Oh, hello
Haresh: Hi, good evening guys.
Srinivasan H: doctor.
Haresh: How are you?
geet: Good. How are you?
Haresh: I'm well. Thanks for taking the time to
geet: No, thank you.
Haresh: meet.
geet: I know it's been a pretty crazy couple weeks for you. I hope your your office has recovered
Haresh: No, everything's great. No complaints. Everything's
geet: good.
Haresh: wonderful.
geet: I don't want to really like I know it's late so I don't want to take up you know crazy time. So what I'll do is first let me introduce you to our chief engineer here Shweeni. Um I can't speak highly enough about how much of an amazing team we have and every ounce of feedback that I've given him has come back to me in less than 24 hours. So I really can't complain. Um and Shini Dr. Alani is a good friend and a excellent friend and a cataract surgeon. So he will understand the platform very um very
Srinivasan H: Hello, doctor.
geet: well.
Srinivasan H: Nice to meet you.
Haresh: Nice to see you as well.
 
 
00:01:11
 
Haresh: Thank you again.
geet: Um let me go ahead and share my screen and then I'll get
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
geet: started.
Haresh: Let's do it. Thank you.
geet: Um, I promise I'm techsavvy. Hold on a second.
Srinivasan H: or should I share?
geet: Um, let's see. It's Oh, you know what? I had it.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: Um, I have some, you know, I they made me download Google Chrome because usually I use Teams and Oh, here we go. Entire screen. There we go. Share open system. Allow everyone. Can you see the screen or nobody can see it?
Srinivasan H: No,
geet: So,
Srinivasan H: not
Haresh: Not just yet.
geet: okay.
Srinivasan H: yet.
geet: Let's see. Okay. You know what, Triny? I'll let you share it. Let's go to the P. So, let me just give you a little bit of background while he's bringing that up. We have like two portals. Um it the main portal that I'm going to show you today is the patient interface and that's what the user interface of the patient is.
 
 
00:02:26
 
geet: There's a back end which is the doctor's interface where you can actually customize and select. Most of the customization is done automatically by uh through the EMR through either scanning the document or pulling it from the EMR. But obviously as a surgeon you might want to change things and go and alter. You might have somebody who's allergic to a medication. and you want don't want to use your standard protocol etc etc. So you have the ability to customize all of that on the back end as well and we work with your clinic to customize it to begin with. So as you see if the patient has um access they'll go into the clinic and um shiny I just use vision or which you can use whichever one and they they get a basically an OTP. So every time their password will change. So, it's a pretty straightforward login. And really, this is the face of what they're going to see. Um, at the top of the screen, there's always going to be a header that with the patient's name and date of birth. And at the bottom, if you can scroll down all the way to the bottom, we have the the clinic information at the footer.
 
 
00:03:39
 
geet: So, if they need a contact, we can put whoever's contact information um we need to in terms of surgical counselor, etc. And we can also customize this to have it customized to the logo of uh the practice as well. So it could be look like it's your portal. Um just really quickly I'm going to introduce you to um our co-founder of iikites and that's Vishal Singh and one of our other engineers Shambi. They're both on the call as well.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
geet: Um so yeah and and then we'll just
Vishal Singh: Hi. Hello. Yeah,
Haresh: Hello everyone.
Vishal Singh: this
geet: continue. Um, so here's what the patient sees and uh it's basically these floating cubes and each one of these is custom the whole thing is customized for the patient. So basically it goes right from the diagnosis to what is surgery, what is an um if you hold on just a second. Um Judy, I'm going to show him the all first.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: um goes from the diagnosis and if you scroll down you can go to your what I options that
 
 
00:04:34
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: was pulled straight from the EMR based on what Dr. Tagayian had recommended for particularly my mom. Is this the same one for my mom Shiny? This the same check.
Srinivasan H: Yes, it's the same one. I've just changed the
geet: Okay, good.
Srinivasan H: name.
geet: And so risk complications with come straight from the consent form the before and after surgery. I'll show you that that's customized for the PRA practice in terms of protocol for post-operative instructions and cost and insurance is the last one also customized for the practice. So if you can scroll all the way up and you go to my diagnosis. So if the patient clicks on the my diagnosis they come to this screen here where it tells them exactly what their diagnosis is. this particular person which was my mom um is has a combined cataract with both nuclear and cortical changes and it pulled it from the right and left eye and if you can see on the right screen this was an AI created image and you can toggle between blurry and clear like that uh but also if you click on anatomical view here you can toggle between what it looks like to have the cataract and what that patient's eye looks like and what it looks like to have a normal eye so they can understand a little bit of the disease state too.
 
 
00:05:51
 
geet: Then if you scroll down um it so again again here additional conditions pulled it from the chart as well and and then if you scroll down if the patient wants to know other cataract types they can see that um and they can also ask it questions if you scroll down further so it'll give you an explanation of what's nuclear sclerosis what's that in case they want to know more specifically what it is um and then if you ex out of or you go back to this one it'll because we think patients students might not know what to ask. Um, we put frequently asked questions under each module. So, if you can see these are the frequently asked questions that were generated and at the very bottom you can see that there is a chat bot. So, if the patient has other more nuanced questions, this is a closed LLM and we um we try to get all of our data from Academy of Opthalmology and a couple of articles that I sent that were from JC um uh RS. So of course you we can we can expand that portal of uh of information if we want to if we want to increase the sources but for now for simplicity sake and for accuracy we kept it from that.
 
 
00:07:01
 
geet: So the chat assistant is uh again broad it can you can ask it really any question. It will not direct you on what to do. There are disclaimers for that because um it'll direct you to ask your surgeon. Now if you click out of there shiny um there where the benefits are like on if you click on what is cataract surgery and we'll just be briefly go through each module and then if you want to ask me questions in between we can or I can go through everything and you want to ask at the end what do you
Haresh: Just keep going.
geet: prefer um so here we have these all these videos are again
Haresh: This is great.
geet: from YouTube and they're from AAO we've given them given them credit here this gives you the definitions of what traditional surgery if you can scroll um what this is the difference between traditional and then if you scroll down a little bit more you get what's the difference between laser assisted um I didn't really call it phento because a lot of patients don't understand what phento is I try to keep the language simple and then if you go on go down a little bit now in the green light sorry a little bit above there it says you are eligible for laser because in the in the EMR it was suggested to my mom that she's eligible for this so and that can be in the drop-own menu on your end you can click really quickly what you want them to be eligible for too.
 
 
00:08:15
 
geet: So, um, if you click down, it explains what laser assisted surgery and I try to make it really simple. The language we kind of modify to make it simple and of course I'll give this to you later so you can play around with you can like take a look at the language but you can see that it's not just a lot of people think they ask me they think the laser does the whole surgery. So, I wanted to make it very clear that you talk about the incisions right there in the beginning. The advanced methods offers a higher degree of precision for a stigmatism and lens placement. After these incisions are created, your surgeon still uses the ultrasound device to break up or remove the cataract and subsequently a lymph implant called an ol is carefully inserted and then there's the video and then you can scroll down and you can see frequently asked questions like number one is what's the difference between traditional and laser etc. And you can scroll down further and you get the chatbot again. So does insurance um cover this? Obviously not.
 
 
00:09:08
 
geet: So you can keep going. So we can X out of this and go to the next module. The next one is just explaining to the patient what an ol is. Um I kind of kept it simple by first understanding the vision ranges before we really get into the conversation. Um and then this gives you your you know the basics. Now I got some feedback. Some people want a fourth range to show moni mini mono but we'll get into that later. But I try to keep it simple for now. distance, intermediate, and near so that they understand the language. And then the lens options that I put in here. And again, we can increase this, but I put in these four because I think the these are probably the four most common that people do. And if you click on each of them, it explains what it is. It goes down here, it tells you your trade-offs, your it's covered by most insurance, but it requires glasses. Um it does not correct a stigmatism, etc. And then if you go down, um, if you have a stigmatism, you're going to need this monop focal, but you're going to need a toric version of it.
 
 
00:10:07
 
geet: And this particular one is not covered. So it'll and then and then it gives you the mono vision because that's also under the monopocal um category. So we can X out of monopal for a second. And then um, yeah, back to all lenses. And then for example, multif focal. You can see that one. All ranges of vision. um far computer near and then it goes to the trade-offs you know versus you know the pros and cons your um you might have halos and glare your brain needs might might need time some time to adapt the premium cost is not covered by just basics I can always add more and then the if you have a stigmatism usually I just put this this torque multif focal because it's included in most practices with the cost of the multif focal if you put in a toric um so I didn't put any disclaimer for at least in our practice there's no additional cost to get a torque um for the torque multif focal. So if you if you scroll down just a little bit um Shiny uh scroll the other way.
 
 
00:11:08
 
geet: Sorry. Yeah. No, no, sorry. Down towards the um questions under multif focal. Go back to multif focal.
Srinivasan H: Uh
geet: Yeah. And then you can scroll all the way down so you can see the rest.
Srinivasan H: yes.
geet: That's that's it. And then if you X out of there, uh the questions and stuff will kind of be in if you scroll all the way down. Now you'll go to um how how long a lot of people ask these silly questions. How long does it last? Um will I feel it? These are some basic things about um and then if they ask you can still go to the chatbot and ask it something about a multif focal or like why you know what is the difference between that etc etc. So you can you can ask questions and then of course you can ask broader questions about your surgery. It doesn't have to be an IEL question in this module because the chatbot is geared for the whole whole software. And we can ex out of this and go to the next mod.
 
 
00:12:07
 
geet: And then it goes then it pulled from the EMR. If you go to my options, um it pulled for my mom or for this particular patient. I shouldn't keep saying my mom. Um it tells you told you which options she's eligible for. So, if you want to really take a look at what I'm eligible for. And then if you scroll down, um, it goes, it just gives you a basic amount of, uh, keep scrolling. Um, keep going. Keep going. It gives you what's covered. Like if you, if she chose the monofoc, this patient chose the mono focal, keep going. And if they chose the with the monopocal with laser, this would be the cost on the right side. And you can keep going down. and like the benefits or risks or not, you know, just things to consider with each of these choices that are very tailored to that patient based on that patient's EMR. And so, same thing, we can, you know, scroll all the way down. Same things, same frequently asked questions at the bottom of each of these things and then you have the chatbot as well.
 
 
00:13:09
 
geet: So you these were all these options and it you know keep the it go it it goes through all of that and you know we hope that the doctor still explains it but this is a chance for somebody to go back and really understand it if they want to see these and what they're getting what benefits they're getting from it. So we can ex out of this and then comes uh risks and complications. Uh this also came out of the consent form. So we have kind of like two blocks which are like common and expected just because these things will happen to most patients and you can keep going. Um and then the less common infection, bleeding, pressure, swelling, corial abrasions, I mean retinal detachments, rupture of capsule capsular tear, dislocation. I put everything I could think of um there. And then we put specific ones for things like uh laser assisted things that came that these things came from OMIC. Um, and then some of them I expanded on. Uh, and then there's always a disclaimer here. And then frequently asked questions are there.
 
 
00:14:11
 
geet: And of course the chatbot, same same thing. So again, they can go into each of these in detail or uh and then you know have go to the chatbot to ask more specific questions. And we can ex out of this now. Um, and we can we can actually tailor this to the um clinic's uh consent form if you don't want it to be as comprehensive or if you want it to have just the basics to look like your consent form that would be fine too. Now, if you go to the before surgery, is this where we had the forms?
Srinivasan H: Yeah. Yes. Yes.
geet: So,
Srinivasan H: Uh
geet: we have a section for forms and documents so that the patient can upload their medical clearance.
Srinivasan H: yes.
geet: they can upload their consent form and sign it. And once they give it back to you and it's signed, your surgical counselor can scan it and it'll automatically load the scanned signed version for that patient. So they always have a copy of what they've signed as well. Um, so that's the forms and documents section.
 
 
00:15:06
 
geet: Again, that's customized to the clinic, but you know, we I thought of three big one as three big forms that most patients will have to sign is a consent form and then the selection form just to verify. Yes, I chose this IL and I understand that this insurance covers it or doesn't cover it. And then the medical clearance form for their doctor. And there we kept one for each eye just in case there's space between their medical clearance. Um sometimes, you know, you can have one medical clearance for both surgeries and that's something the surgical counselor can you know X out or decide. Now if you go to the medications and preparation it'll also go to go through uh go make sure that the s you know the correct pharmacy is selected for the patient and automatically puts in the date of surgery. It tells gives like a ticker to when their surgery is. Tells them what time um actually when it go what time they have to arrive, tracking of their eye drops for surgery. And then we can go right into the day um of s of surgery if you want to.
 
 
00:16:05
 
geet: And there's also frequently asked questions like um you know don't drink. There's instructions. And then we have a we have the preop instructions here um which like don't eat or drink uh you know after midnight etc. Um if you go to the next section on the day of surgery this is kind of your check-in registration preparation tell gives the patient an idea of what to expect the day they come in. Tells them what time to arrive and that's all assigned by the surgical counselor. the surgical counselor just puts that in and um they have to enter that in manually because we don't know, you know, everyone's time is different and it could change. It'll automatically populate that way. Hopefully, it'll prevent them from calling you back and asking you a hundred questions like where am I going, what you know, it tells you the location, the surgery center, the time, etc., and what you know what what you're expected and if you go, you know, that you're going to have large pupils afterwards for a couple of days, etc., etc. What are the common things that you're going to feel?
 
 
00:17:05
 
geet: You might have a patch and a shield on, etc. And again, some people do with a patch, some people don't. I just put it on because, you know, just for demo purposes. And then really, uh, if you keep going down to the next section, next section on the after surgery, this gives the patient an idea of what to expect after surgery and what drops they have to take. For example, I just did it. You know, we have a drop down on the surgeon's end which you just have to select which is your posttop regimen. We can also scan your preop or posttop sheet and import it and have it uh automatically register in here. Um it says so and then it has a tracker. The patient can opt for this tracker or not. So if they want they can get a notification on their phone that they're due for their eye drop. tells them when to take it and if they click it confirms that they've taken their drop and you know this one goes some people have droplets some people have all three some people have a combo we have in the drop-own menu on the doctor side which I'm not showing you yet can show you that I can show you that side as well um on that dropown you can see that you can choose whatever configuration you want and um goes goes to the recovery section what not to do what to do again you know don't get water in your
 
 
00:18:25
 
geet: eye etc. This is just basically a copy of your posttop instruction sheet and then of course very important when you should call your doctor and then the frequently asked questions and again there's some question if you don't like the format of this for the practice and you have something else and you want to parallel it to your sheet that's fine too because I talked to somebody else and they're like well I still want to give a hard copy to the patient. I was like that's fine but they're like but my patient always says they lose they lose their paper so this is kind of a nice backup. So that's the that's that and then if you click out of there then the cost and insurance uh is the last part. Again I don't have it integrated just yet with um actual health insurance which would be a nice add-on feature but what I do have is these options. And again every practice is different. So on the back end, you'll see again it's just a drop- down menu based on what your practice does. And I if you scroll down here, Sheni, this is based on like I guess what practice I'm used to.
 
 
00:19:25
 
geet: It goes through each of the um lenses if and the out-ofpocket fees based on what lens you choose and we customize that for the practice. And so when the patient um basically clicks on it and says I want I they will have an option to click and say I want this lens at some point that will automatically be visible from the on the back end from the surgical counselor's perspective and then they will know what the what lens that that patient has picked and can go on and order that as well. Um, so we can X out of this if you feel like it right now. And I know I don't want to bore you too much. If we can show you the back end of what the doctor sees in terms of really quickly and how that that works, that part of it works.
Haresh: Yes,
geet: Are
Haresh: please.
geet: okay. Is Gmail off just in case? I think you spell Gmail.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: There you go. So, it gives the doctor a dashboard um of their patients or and let's say you're looking at a particular patient.
 
 
00:21:04
 
geet: You want to look at the clinic. Let's look at the clinic data what they fill out fill out. So basic things we thought that you you we that you can customize is like what
Srinivasan H: That's it.
geet: information your you know you want the patient to see for the clinic. Um which staff has access to the portal. Um for example, you know, you want you might want the surgical counselor to have access. You might want your tech to have access. It just could it could it could vary. um you get you know you get these options to customize that. If you look at the packages um you can see that these are your packages that you can customize and we just put you know standard package, standard mono if you go down you have we have standard monopocal etc um monopocal laser extended depth and these can all be customized for the practice. when you get onboarded, we do this. So, it's like a one-time thing. We and we help you do it or we can actually pull it from we can actually program it um to pull it from whatever data you have that's printed or in a PDF file.
 
 
00:22:15
 
geet: And then lens inventory you can customize as well. I mean, we put some basic lenses in here, but you know, some doctors will just have alcon, some doctors will just have J&J. The patient doesn't really need to know all of that. I just kept basic categories. But if you want to customize it on your end so that when they choose the, for example, the multif focal, it automatically is going to make you choose a vividity, whatever, whatever you that you you'll know you're going to have to choose a vividity or whatever um or a panoptics or whatever. And then the medications part you're going to you can customize because you have we have all the preop medications that I could think of here the posttop. So that we and of course these can be added. There's another section is that the admin section Shiny where we add things and we show that's the admin section.
Srinivasan H: Uh, yes. Yes, it's the admin section.
geet: So that's basic so this is like for the doctor if they want to change anything and again this is just really during the onboarding process I I would think that this won't take too much time and it'll just pretty much 99% be for applicable for each clinic for almost all the doctors.
 
 
00:23:21
 
geet: Um and then we can just quickly go to the admin section. I can show how we pull up specifics.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes.
geet: So, can you show how you can customize this section?
Srinivasan H: Uh yes. Uh if let's say a clinic is registered uh first thing is the admin will get the uh notification that uh someone is trying to register their clinic uh to use our platform. So we'll get the option here. So uh I think all the clinics we have currently approved. If let's say uh any status isn't pending like the status is waiting for approval uh we can approve it here. Currently we have not registered any clinic. Uh so we have not got any option. If any clinic is registered we'll get the option to approve that clinic or directly reject them. Uh uh that particular part uh uh the admin will have the uh priority to handle
geet: And where is it?
Srinivasan H: that.
geet: Uh where in the portal um Shini is can you customize like remember we had the review of systems and if we wanted to change something manually and the patient's diagnosis or something uh we could do that.
 
 
00:24:59
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. That part that was for the doctor's portal itself.
geet: That's what I wanted to show
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: too.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: I think it's Deep Gmail
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: and is that where the alerts show up too?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
geet: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, currently we have so many patients. Uh this is all I'll go to one of the patient
geet: Right.
Srinivasan H: here.
geet: So this is if you want to change something like you look again the EMR um is
Srinivasan H: Yes.
geet: scanned like your the patient's chart. So far what we did is we ch we scan the patient's chart and it pull the data from the patient's chart right there. You can upload the EMR and the master and everything in there and it scans everything and pulls it pulls all the right data to the right to um the right places. But if you think something is wrong and you look at it and you're like, I don't really want to make a big deal about their cortical stuff and it's not really that bad.
 
 
00:26:09
 
geet: I'm going to take that out. You can cut you can change anything over here. Like so if you if you if the tech wants to go in and you know add a medication that they're on, add a systemic condition that they're on that wasn't captured, they can do that because it's it's going to be as good as what you feed it. So if you felt like something was left out on the EMR, you want to add it later because it, you know, it wasn't written down, you can you can manually go and add whatever you wanted to. You can add the type of cataract. Maybe you forgot to say that there's posterior subcapsular and you want to add that. You can do that, too. So it can show the patient. It'll show up on the patient's side. Um, it'll takes all the stuff and it it also imports that data. As you can see, we kept these basic numbers here, axial length. And if you want to just have a glimpse at it at some point, you know, you can see how much stigmatism there is.
 
 
00:27:00
 
geet: You can um look at the stigmatism through both ILL master and your pentac. And I put slash topography because everybody doesn't have a pentacam. And if you don't want to use the stigmatism pull because there's like so many numbers, you can you want to look at you know the total TK or whatever, you can customize it to pull that and or or you know manually put any of this in if you feel like it. Coorbidities right there. Um lifestyle and then we have uh you know we smoking any of the things any social history visual goals are in there. We have the visual questionnaire. So if people you know we we did we have questionnaires that people have on personality traits like if they're type A you know how we do that for multif focals if if the if they want to um you know if the tech wants to go and manually put in you know this is their personality so you can just quickly look at this and and see that and then this is symptoms that they pull directly from the uh EMR patient has difficulty driving at night has you know issues with glare halos and then down here is where you can see the candidacy.
 
 
00:28:06
 
geet: Again, this pulled it from the EMR because in the EMR it was very specified that patient is a candidate for X, Y, and Z, but you might say when you're looking at this, well, you know, I really don't want to do a multif even though they're they are a candidate for multif focal. I had a discussion with them and it just doesn't seem like they're going to be a great candidate for it. Let me just X out. So, it doesn't show that they're a candidate, but it'll still show that type of lens on the patient portal, but it won't be a my recommendation. Um, the monovision strategies here, packages are here. So, all of this is on the doctor side that if you again, it tries to do all the work for you, but if there's something you wanted to change, you have the ability to change it is what I'm trying to say on this on this section on the back end. So, you have all these options. um your medications, your forms and documents. You can you can customize this is all customizable um for so so that your preop.
 
 
00:29:04
 
geet: So if you look at the medications uh can we scroll up just a little bit? So then try to make it really easy. So if in your posttop regimen if you can you click on select antibiotic under that drop-own menu. So we have these choices here. Um, and then we have, if you click on the combination drop in the middle, we have that as a choice, too. And then if you scroll down a little bit, you can tell what kind of schedule you want. Do you want a tapered schedule? What do you want for week one? What do you want for week two? That way, it automatically shows up in the patient's portal of what you want for that patient. This is something that the surgical counselor can do or again, we can make it standardized for the practice if it's the same. I just did it so that it's customizable in case that in a practice one doctor does something very differently than the other doctor so that you have a way to go and change it if you wanted to and you don't have to call back and call tech support or whatever to do it.
 
 
00:30:03
 
geet: So that's pretty much in a nutshell hish um what the software is capable of doing. What are your initial thoughts?
Haresh: Would you be able to send uh like a link so I can play with it some
geet: Absolutely.
Srinivasan H: Yes,
Haresh: more?
Srinivasan H: sure.
Haresh: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: Right now.
Haresh: I can send you guys my email and then you can send it to me.
geet: Mhm.
Haresh: I need some time to process everything.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
Haresh: It's a lot of information.
geet: Right.
Srinivasan H: Sure. Sure. Sure.
geet: What do you think about the user interface or the patient portal in terms of usability and understanding of their options
Haresh: It looks great. Um,
geet: etc.
Haresh: it's a lot of great information. Um, it covers a lot of your FAQs essentially which will help on the patient education side and the compliance side. For me, what I'm trying to figure out is how to use this in our clinical practice without slowing us down. And then I think the more important aspect is, can this be embedded into an EMR?
 
 
00:31:14
 
geet: So th that's a great question and I think I'm going to try give that question to our very prestigious technical team that they know the answers to that one.
Srinivasan H: Yes, currently we we will be able to integrate uh into uh the EMR. First we wanted to study how the EMR integration structure works. Basically how what kind of EMS uh do people have at uh their uh clinics. We wanted to know because uh I feel if there are different different EM for each and every clinics then we need to see how to integrate it. We have uh figured out multiple options to uh directly connect to EMR and uh pick it up. Uh I think we will be able to integrate it into the EMR
Haresh: Right.
Vishal Singh: So how do you
Haresh: In the US, there's really two major EMR companies that dominate the marketplace and uh
Vishal Singh: check?
Srinivasan H: part.
Haresh: have most of the market share. So, this to me is a great product, but it's going to have to integrate and it's going to have to embed into an EMR for it to be more useful in a clinic
 
 
00:32:19
 
geet: So my ask to Horatio is if we want to do that um is if we need
Haresh: setting.
geet: permission from someone to test it out with their EMR that's so yeah obviously we
Haresh: Yep.
geet: would sign all the documentation and be HIPPA compliant there's no doubt about that but in order to build all of the I guess APIs is what you would call it to pull that data we'd have to actually go into your EMR and understand how to do that from a techn tech you know a technical
Haresh: Right. No, of course. Of course. I also think that it's important to see the two major EMR companies that are out there. Uh what they if they have anything like this currently. Um and if they don't, which I don't believe they do, um where does your product fit in? So that's what I need to spend some time thinking about some more. I just need to look at the product and see where there's because there's some significant overlap here by the way. So I'm just thinking about our EMR system, right?
 
 
00:33:21
 
Haresh: There's some overlap between this system and that.
geet: Right.
Haresh: So we need to figure out how not to have redundant workflows. Uh because that's you can't be entering things into two systems.
Vishal Singh: Right.
Haresh: It has to be one system and everything talks to one another and you have seamless workflow.
Vishal Singh: Yes.
Haresh: That's the only way things um are
geet: So just so you we entered nothing into the system.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: beneficial.
geet: We just scanned my mom's documents from her from the and everything was pulled from that.
Haresh: Correct.
geet: However, we built it so that if you wanted to change something, you you have the ability to change on the back and you really don't have to enter
Haresh: No,
geet: anything.
Haresh: what I mean more along the lines of is um if you are saying to a patient this is your surgical time, this is your surgical center,
geet: Right. You're right.
Haresh: all of the data that a patient would need because what you're creating is essentially a patient
geet: Right.
Haresh: tracker um to guide them through the journey right from the beginning.
 
 
00:34:17
 
geet: Mhm. Mhm.
Haresh: Okay, here's your preop stuff. Here's what your decision is for surgery. This is what your consent forms are going to look like. And then this is what your posttop care is going to look is going to look like. Most of this information is already embedded into your EMR. The problem is with there's no great way to present it to the patient. What you're doing is essentially presenting the stuff that we have in our system to a patient in an easy to access,
geet: Okay.
Haresh: easy to read format. So you're just transitioning data that we have already, which is great. The thing is is that the idea makes total sense to me. it's how to execute it because again redundancy is going to be an issue for any clinic that's busy. So how do we automatically extract the salient data and then it's already customized.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: I've already customized it when I saw the patient. Right? So I've already customized it to that particular patient.
geet: Right.
Haresh: Now, all it needs to do is then communicate that and it's basically a take-home assistant for the patient that the patient can then
 
 
00:35:23
 
geet: Exactly.
Vishal Singh: Right.
geet: That's right.
Haresh: use my customizations that I made with them when I saw them to follow their
Vishal Singh: Right.
Haresh: journey. Does that I'm not sure if that's what you're envisioning,
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: but
geet: Yeah, that's exactly what we just need.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: that's
geet: Like I said, we would need access to be able to get that process started.
Haresh: yeah, I have to think about it some more of how it would work. But that's why let me just play with it some more and I'll get back to you.
geet: Yeah.
Haresh: But that's what I'm in.
geet: So,
Haresh: But that's the way I see this kind of interfacing with it is it's got to embed with an EMR.
geet: perfect.
Vishal Singh: Right. And just to uh harish just to add to what Shinas said uh what has happened in recent times is the ability of AI to see you know has become quite quite uh quite uh quite great. So it means you know there are there are two ways to integrate within AMR. One is the old way you play out with the APIs.
 
 
00:36:20
 
Vishal Singh: You do a very uh hardcore integration. You talk with the vendor. You get their API key and all. The other is you you know you use a browser you use right some plug-in which has the ability to see the records there from there you know from uh the browser itself right we have done some tests right but we need to do extensive tests but it looks like it's quite possible that you kind of click one button right you go through a EMR which which may span multiple screens uh in your proprietary software as you're doing it the AI is seeing things AI is absorbing information and once once once you have finally spanned all your screens you could just say that extract the data and then the data comes to you know uh the cat track agent from there it can be you know uh you know you can correct it the only thing I I was thinking in my head is uh if there are two and fros right you know for example if you if again the EMR data changes that uh that kind of synchronization one S2C otherwise the oneway synchronization right uh technologically is is quite feasible.
 
 
00:37:29
 
Haresh: Right. So, you're talking about an API versus an AI pull.
Vishal Singh: Correct. That's absolutely
Haresh: Got it. Okay. I have another question for you.
Vishal Singh: right.
Haresh: How do you see this product as far as do you see it a as a web-based product or do you see it as an app or how do you see it? Because like let's say you're you're seeing a patient, right? And you're going to say to them, "Okay, great. My AI assistant is going to help you through the journey. How do they get how do they access this this AI assistant? Is it a web-based assistant? Is it a downloadable app?
geet: right now.
Haresh: How do you see it playing out?
geet: Right now it's a web link because everybody doesn't want another app on their
Haresh: Correct.
geet: phone.
Haresh: A web link is much better.
geet: So that's how we have it as a web link and then they have that OTP so that they don't have to memorize their password. It's just
Haresh: Right. Right. Of course. Of course.
 
 
00:38:17
 
Haresh: So that's ideal,
geet: like
Haresh: right? That's the ideal thing. So you basically when they're leaving your coordinator, your coordinator sends them a link to their phone and says, "Here, click on this link and this is going to be your tracker through your journey." So,
geet: Mhm.
Haresh: that makes a whole lot of sense.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: Um, I'm just thinking if there's anything else. No, I mean, I'm pretty good. I just need some time to think about it and then I'll get back to you.
Vishal Singh: Oh s***.
geet: Awesome.
Haresh: Hey everyone, thank you so much for your time. This was really informative and and very
Vishal Singh: Yeah,
geet: Thank you.
Vishal Singh: thank
geet: Thank you.
Haresh: useful.
geet: And um Shiny will send you he has your email. We'll just email you the link and the
Vishal Singh: you.
Haresh: You guys have done a wonderful job.
geet: access.
Haresh: I mean it it looks really great and it's nice and uh by the way just one quick question. Your closed end LLM is based on the AAO stuff, correct?
 
 
00:39:11
 
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: Okay. So I mean that's pretty good because that's standard of care
geet: Correct.
Haresh: essentially, right? So I mean that's pretty easy for most patients. I'm just thinking about anything else.
geet: Yeah. We didn't want it to go to Dr.
Haresh: Hm.
geet: Google because then that's when
Haresh: No, no, no. It's good the way it is. Yeah,
geet: Yeah.
Haresh: it's easier for the It truncates the amount of information because otherwise it's too much information. Um I'm just thinking about like the process, right? It's more the the process of how this fits in and where it fits in to to it all
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: because if you don't have the data pull, you'll have to enter these things manually and and you just cannot do that.
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah. Correct.
Haresh: You need to have it synchronized with your EMR. Pull the data however you pull it.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: And then the other thing is is that it needs to be live. Let's say you change your your surgery date, okay, for a patient.
 
 
00:40:06
 
Vishal Singh: Right.
Haresh: It needs to then change in real time.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: So it's not just a one-time pull,
geet: Mhm.
Haresh: right?
Vishal Singh: Right.
Haresh: It has to be synchronization. Otherwise, I mean, that's where these things get tricky.
Vishal Singh: Right. Right.
Haresh: So,
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: this is one of those things where it really has to embed into an EMR for it to be super useful.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: Um, because then
geet: Do you have the dates and all in your em like in our practice we have practice management separate
Haresh: it
geet: from our EMR. So do you have surgical dates and surgical schedule in your everything is in one place.
Haresh: everything in one place. You see,
geet: Okay.
Haresh: most practices are going to move. you're on a different system because of of your setup, but most practices are moving towards integrated practice management, integrated EMR, right? That's the future of it all. Even these private equity big big corporations are going to move to that because of ease of use and just like Mr. Vishal said, right?
 
 
00:41:03
 
Haresh: It's having to pull data from one system to the next. It's just an inefficient thing. Um, you you want integration so you have less pulling. So long term,
Vishal Singh: s***.
Haresh: everyone is going to have to integrate to one system that does both. So if you have one system that has everything, anything that's an add-on to it has to integrate to the system to make it worthwhile. Otherwise, now you're entering into three different systems. It's just cumbersome. It's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to use it.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Haresh: And it looks, you guys did a beautiful job. It looks so pretty. It's just a very cool looking system.
geet: Well, thank you.
Haresh: It's going to evolve,
geet: I'm glad that
Haresh: but it's very cool. So congratulations to all of you. Thank you so much.
geet: thanks.
Haresh: Have a great uh for you guys in India. Have a great day and get have a nice evening.
geet: All right, I'll talk to you soon.
Haresh: Take care.
geet: All right,
Haresh: Bye-bye.
 
 
00:41:55
 
Haresh: Thank you again.
geet: good night.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Thank you.
geet: Thanks, guys. I think that went well. What do you think?
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah, it was
Srinivasan H: I think it went well. Uh yeah,
geet: Yeah.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: amazing.
Srinivasan H: we need to think about the EMR integration. Yeah, we'll apply our mind and see what all the options we have.
geet: I mean, we're really lucky that we're dealing with a a a basically a a a field of medicine that only has two basic EMRs that dominate. I mean, if you look at all the other fields, there's like hundreds of different EMR systems, right? And everybody's using something else. But this is really nice that we can work with the two major ones and capture over 85% of our market. So, we'll just I'll just let you send him the link and we'll go from
Srinivasan H: Yeah,
geet: there.
Srinivasan H: I'll send him the link and uh I had made some changes that's why I want I wanted to share it. Uh did you see some changes the mono vision and I had those
 
 
00:42:51
 
geet: Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. Yeah. So,
Srinivasan H: things.
geet: um, you know, again, I think that I think that those are good. I think I like the way that the mono vision and the toric monocal are both under monocal lens because they're all monopal lenses. So, I I like that as a subcategory and you did I think we did that as a nice um nice addition. Uh I did I was trying to show it today to another doctor on my phone and you know that image that shows the eye and also the image of the painting or
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: whatever that took forever to download then it didn't download.
Srinivasan H: The image.
geet: It downloads nicely when you do it from a computer and you can toggle like that but it
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: didn't do it at all on the phone. I don't know. And I was connected to Wi-Fi.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: It was a restaurant, so I was connected to a public Wi-Fi, but it was everything else was working fine on the phone
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
00:43:55
 
Srinivasan H: In the phone,
geet: just but I'm just I just wanted to give
Srinivasan H: I think the UI is not that great. I'll change that UI.
geet: you that feedback. I don't know if anything can be done at this stage or you know we need to more funding for that kind of thing. So um but you just so if you if there's anything you can think of that's easy then we can change it. But that's the only problem I ran into.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I'll look into it.
geet: All right. Well, uh, going to schedule probably one more demo next week.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh, is it another doctor?
geet: A different doctor. Yeah,
Srinivasan H: uh with the doctor or just Okay,
geet: the doctor. This one, this doctor is in Canada.
Srinivasan H: fine.
geet: We'll see what happens.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: He's really nice.
Srinivasan H: Uh I'll just share the screen. I'll just show that because that mono
geet: Go ahead. Yeah, share it. Let me see all the And I'm so curious as
 
 
00:44:52
 
Srinivasan H: vision I just wanted to confirm it once.
geet: to what you did with the UX because we're even working on it. You know, when I see that I think if we make that cube more three-dimensional, round the corners, change the colors a little bit, it's going to be I think people will like it.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Okay.
geet: Everything I've seen out there is just a page of information.
Srinivasan H: Just
geet: There's nothing fun about it.
Srinivasan H: h Uh yes uh you can just check this uh uh descriptions because I have not verified it with you. I have added it but I have not verified. You can just check this once.
geet: Yeah, I think that's
Srinivasan H: Uh you're able to see it.
geet: perfect
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: on monopocal. If you scroll up, so it says requires glasses for reading and intermediate.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
geet: If you have a stigmatism, you may also need glasses for distance. Okay, that's good. And then I do think that at some point if I, you know, we have to have a disclaimer tick box.
 
 
00:46:36
 
geet: If I choose this lens, I understand that I will need to wear glasses.
Srinivasan H: Hmh that uh in my IO options we need to give that option.
geet: Yeah. Yeah. just that I think that'll be a nice feature.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
geet: We don't have to do it for purposes of um you
Srinivasan H: This
geet: know Oh, he just texted me. Thank you for allowing me to meet with you and your team. Great product. Congrats. Okay, cool. All right, let's see. All right. I think we should highlight um maybe like the things to know is important, but at the bottom maybe have a separate box for each of these things. And people are dumb. Okay, I'm just tell I'm sorry. like have another box just like you have this little box and say do I need glasses with this you know and then yes or no it'll just say yes and then another sentence you need glasses
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: for this all you will need glass you will be dependent on glasses if you choose this option okay something simple but just another box
 
 
00:48:06
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: to just specifically talking about glasses or no glasses because that's the that's the really the main reason people choose these lenses because they don't want to wear glasses right so just as a summary like they might get lost in all this print but just as a separate do I need glasses and
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: then you know and then it we always want to say you
Srinivasan H: All right.
geet: will you will be dependent like on the multif focal you don't want to say that you will eliminate glasses because anybody can wear glasses and make it just a little bit sharper. Right? You want to say you will you will reduce your dependence the most the glass on glasses the most with a multif focal option. Um generally the multif focal lens allows you to see clearly without glasses in all ranges of vision. That's it. I mean you've already talked about the glare and halos but I'm talking about in that separate box. is just a box about glasses. You know what I'm saying? I think that will be helpful.
 
 
00:49:13
 
geet: If you think it's too much, that's fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: But I think that if you just do it like, you know how you have this bold red right there in the second line, just have another box at the bottom underneath the underneath the benefits and things right
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: before how does your doctor decide? like a little box with a bold red saying glasses yes no and a tick mark you know yes and do I need glasses tick mark yes no and then just a quick sentence of what you why they would need glasses that's it for each of each of the
Srinivasan H: Got it. Got it. Got it.
geet: options and mono
Srinivasan H: Okay.
geet: vision is you know a little bit unique because you don't really need glasses explain that.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I'll add that.
geet: Okay. What did you think? I mean,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
geet: do you think we'll be able to integrate it with the EMR once we have access to the EMR?
Srinivasan H: Uh yes, surely I think we can integrate it. We just need to see how how efficient it is for the doctor to play around with it.
 
 
00:50:21
 
Srinivasan H: I understand what he told the issues that he told. He told that uh we need to update in the EMR and again come to your portal and update it there as well. Uh he told that latency should not be there. Just put it at one place and it should automatically synchronize to other place. Yeah, we'll think about it. We'll apply your mind what to
geet: Okay.
Srinivasan H: do.
geet: All right. Thanks, guys.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Have a great evening,
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Git. Thank

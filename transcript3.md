00:00:56
 
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: one of the things I didn't put on the list is for the demo, it's probably a good idea to switch my mom's name to somebody else generic and switch her date of birth just so they don't like she's not everywhere. Everybody's
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yeah. I can do
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: that.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah. Yeah. I was asking about the Chinese New Year. Actually, there's a conflict between China and India.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: So, we don't celebrate Chinese New
gitanjali baveja: you don't celebrate. Yeah. Well,
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Year.
gitanjali baveja: I had dated this guy who was Taiwanese. So, I had when I was dating him, we had to celebrate it every time with his
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Wow, nice.
gitanjali baveja: family.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Okay, cool.
gitanjali baveja: That's it. That's gone.
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: No longer am I dating him anyway.
 
 
00:01:49
 
gitanjali baveja: So
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah, I'll just keep myself mute and I'll switch off my video. Uh we can continue further.
gitanjali baveja: yeah, I hope that wasn't recorded. You should stop recording and re-record right now,
Shambhavi Maski Kunutigi Mata: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: please.
Srinivasan H: I know
gitanjali baveja: Thanks. So that my life is not in this video in case anybody wants to hear this again.
Srinivasan H: No, no, I'm not recording it.
gitanjali baveja: Can you please cut?
Srinivasan H: Uh,
gitanjali baveja: Can you please cut the first part and at this time just
Srinivasan H: no, no, I don't think so.
gitanjali baveja: continue?
Srinivasan H: It's recording. Uh, still I' have not started the
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Okay.
Srinivasan H: recording.
gitanjali baveja: Thanks.
Srinivasan H: Uh, okay. So, first thing is like you told you had a demo. So, what happened to that?
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. So, I had the demo Stephanie Chen. problem with her. She's willing to pilot, but they only have a paper chart.
 
 
00:02:49
 
gitanjali baveja: How are we supposed to deal with that?
Srinivasan H: uh they have paper charts of the medical
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: data.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Handwritten.
Srinivasan H: So handwritten so it is in
gitanjali baveja: So, we'd have to do a modified version.
Srinivasan H: doctor's language or
gitanjali baveja: We'd have to do a modified version where we're not pulling too much data from the patient's chart and the the doctor can
Srinivasan H: h
gitanjali baveja: tell the diagnosis with the drop- down menu and the recommendations.
Srinivasan H: H okay uh even though if it is paper charts I don't think so it will be a problem because if they upload any we are using a model to extract things whatever is there in the charts or in our EMR I think that will also work
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: fine but we need to know how the data it is like have they how doctors usually used to write If is it like that or it is just a generic form or something? How how will that paper chart look
gitanjali baveja: the form, but they they're handwritten,
 
 
00:03:55
 
Srinivasan H: like?
gitanjali baveja: like the diagnosis is handwritten,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: so that might be
Srinivasan H: Yeah,
gitanjali baveja: challenging.
Srinivasan H: it might be challenging but we can check it or we can test it out whether it's our
gitanjali baveja: Okay, we Yeah.
Srinivasan H: extraction model is able.
gitanjali baveja: So, I'm waiting for more feedback because I gave her the link to look at the user interface in more detail to see if she wants to demo it in her office. Even if we don't have it extract all the data, if they can at least pull from the drop down the diagnosis for the patient and the the you know lens recommendations then of it the is you know pretty much we can customize for that patient easily,
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: right? It's not really it just won't give all the alerts because it won't know and we can scan the master the document for the and the topography because that's all um you know not that's not handwritten
Srinivasan H: Yes. Yes, that we can do that.
gitanjali baveja: right.
 
 
00:04:59
 
Srinivasan H: Already the process is there. It's working fine. uh I think even the handwritten will work because these models nowadays
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: are very good at extracting whatever they want. I think we have to test it. we can test it and if it doesn't work then whatever approach the manual way of uh extracting
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: and displaying uh in the drop down or something we can add on to
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Okay.
Srinivasan H: that.
gitanjali baveja: And then tomorrow we have remember we were going to do that demo with Dr. Alani um and he had to cancel because there was a pipe gas leak or something in the building he wants to do. He texted me he wants to do the demo tomorrow.
Srinivasan H: So yes, sure. We can do tomorrow morning, right?
gitanjali baveja: Can we do it tomorrow? Same time tonight, but tomorrow for tomorrow for me,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: but maybe 1 hour ahead. Like it's 11 o'clock here.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, sure.
 
 
00:05:57
 
gitanjali baveja: We'll do it 10:00.
Srinivasan H: Uh we can do that. Uh yes,
gitanjali baveja: Can you go ahead and send the invite again to him on that?
Srinivasan H: I will share the invite again.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. And with me as well. Okay. So that's one one other thing on the agenda.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then if you want to go down the list of things on the feedback that I those notes I did, we can just do those and talk about maybe we can try to fix those before the demo
Srinivasan H: H yes. Uh okay.
gitanjali baveja: tomorrow.
Srinivasan H: So the first point you were telling about the posttop drops.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Let me just go through it.
gitanjali baveja: Remember I said they have to be five minutes apart.
Srinivasan H: Okay. For different eyes, right? Uh for different eyes it is it should be 5 minutes apart
gitanjali baveja: No, no, no. each I like if you if I put a drop at 8 am the morning drop for the antibiotic then I can't put the same drop the same
 
 
00:06:54
 
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: time the drop for the anti-inflammatory 8 a.m. I have to space it.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: One at 8, one at 8:05, one at 810. Hi, Michelle.
Vishal Singh: Hi G. Good. Good. Please,
gitanjali baveja: How are you?
Vishal Singh: please proceed. Sorry to barge in
gitanjali baveja: Oh, no,
Srinivasan H: Hello.
gitanjali baveja: no.
Vishal Singh: directly.
gitanjali baveja: Thanks for coming on. We're going to actually do another demo. Hopefully the guy won't cancel on us tomorrow.
Vishal Singh: Yeah,
gitanjali baveja: So, hopefully you can join us for that call,
Vishal Singh: sure. Sure.
gitanjali baveja: too. We'll get some feedback.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: So,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you see what I'm think? So, if it's a right eye and they have to take their antibiotic at 8:00 a.m.,
Srinivasan H: So,
gitanjali baveja: then they've got to take their steroid at 8:05 and their other drop at 8:10.
Srinivasan H: got it. That is for the posttops, right? Not for the preops. It doesn't matter for pre
 
 
00:07:49
 
gitanjali baveja: Uh, any preop is only one drop anyways,
Srinivasan H: preops.
gitanjali baveja: just antibiotics.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it. Uh, I'll fix that. Uh and the next thing was uh posttop instructions included basics in the FAQ but there was no list of specific instruction other than the drops.
gitanjali baveja: So, I didn't see it. Remember we had a a sheet that said you can't wear makeup,
Srinivasan H: So
gitanjali baveja: you have to sleep on your back, you can't lift anything heavy, you can't bend over more, you know, for extended period of time. There was a sheet in the posttop instructions giving those instructions. So that should be somewhere written in so it shouldn't be just the posttop instruction for the drop. It should be a list of instructions for that they could refer to and
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: not just an FAQ.
Srinivasan H: just give me a minute.
gitanjali baveja: Sure. And maybe I missed it.
Srinivasan H: Let me just
gitanjali baveja: So if you can pull it up that would be great.
Vishal Singh: And I was just uh following some certain old notes.
 
 
00:08:57
 
Vishal Singh: So what is this hand handwritten data?
gitanjali baveja: Oh, the handwritten. So, I did a demo with Dr. Chen and she's the one who said, "I'll I'll be happy to test it out in my office," but she they don't use EMR. They only use handwritten notes. So, I think it might be a little difficult. It's not impossible because what we can do is on the on the front end for the doctor, all they'd have to do is from the drop-
Vishal Singh: upload.
gitanjali baveja: down menu select the diagnosis and select the lens
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: recommendation.
Vishal Singh: Right. And
gitanjali baveja: The rest we just say like we can't do functionality. We can't do that many alerts because it's not going to pull in stuff from the EMR as nicely as we wanted to from handwriting.
Vishal Singh: It's it's quite possible you know because these softwares now can really recognize handwriting quite well you know even compared to one year back.
gitanjali baveja: Doctor's handwriting is really
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah. We should try.
 
 
00:09:56
 
gitanjali baveja: bad.
Vishal Singh: I I would say we should try.
gitanjali baveja: I say we try it.
Srinivasan H: That is what I
gitanjali baveja: I mean,
Srinivasan H: was.
gitanjali baveja: and see how it works in terms of how much work it is on our end to even if they just drop down a couple of things that they have to select.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: It might make the work a little bit harder on their end.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: But let's just it would be worth trying as a
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: model.
Vishal Singh: So if if we could do an OCR of their handwriting and present our options and then they can select and they can change it. I think which which Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Yeah. They can change it, customize it,
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: make sure it's accurate. Somebody's going to have to check it in the office for
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: accuracy.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: uh key the preop one which you told I think I'm not able to find it uh uh in which document it is actually can you let me know where it
 
 
00:10:42
 
gitanjali baveja: It's a It's a posttop document.
Srinivasan H: is
gitanjali baveja: So, I'll have to go back when I get home. I'm not home now, but um I'll have to go back and find the posttop instruction
Srinivasan H: okay okay
gitanjali baveja: sheet.
Srinivasan H: like uh when you're back home you can just share me where it is I'm not able to find that particular document.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: I understood the points which you told uh I can add
gitanjali baveja: But it's Yeah, it should be like it shouldn't be part of the FAQ.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: It should be naturally like these are your instructions. You have to wear the patch uh for 24 hours, etc., you know, etc., etc. Like you have to do all of
Srinivasan H: Okay,
Vishal Singh: So Shini is is our knowledge base now good enough.
Srinivasan H: got it.
gitanjali baveja: that.
Vishal Singh: You were saying that you wanted to extract more data and all or uh
Srinivasan H: Uh I think it's good enough. But uh that is the thing. I want G to test that chatbot continuously because that is when we know as of my testing it
 
 
00:11:34
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: is working but I don't know the answers are proper or not right.
gitanjali baveja: I've been testing. I think the answers so far I've come across are good.
Srinivasan H: So,
gitanjali baveja: But then I also gave the link to Stephanie, my friend, to test. So, we have another person testing the chatbot. So, I'm going to um touch base with her next week and see what she thinks in terms of the testing of the chatbot too because she might in my mind I feel like we I
Vishal Singh: Right.
gitanjali baveja: already asked the questions. I thought that were relevant. We we incorporated them in the FAQs and now I want another pair of eyes because my I feel like I have a onetrack mind now. I already kind of know what what I've asked
Vishal Singh: Right. And Shini, it might be good uh because you have automated quite a few things,
gitanjali baveja: you
Vishal Singh: right? This whole idea that you you run the bot uh you run this system, right?
 
 
00:12:26
 
Vishal Singh: And uh get the answers, you have AI rank it another AI, right? Whether there is uh any exception or and then you can actually have that uh thing uh I mean that that that should be that can be really helpful, right? Right? And it can flag that this was wrong or this is a missing knowledge base or something of the and do we know that uh everything is coming right now whatever is coming is is through our our system so it is the models are not using their world knowledge.
Srinivasan H: that one we have to figure it out but uh for most of the cases when it gives the sources at the end at that time we can know it is coming from rag but if there is no reference attached then it is coming from the uh uh gemini's knowledge
Vishal Singh: See what uh my my suggestion is now we should and I think this will be very crucial is that
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Vishal Singh: this testing right as we are answering right as we we automate this then for the questions where it is not coming from our rag which we'll know right based
 
 
00:13:33
 
gitanjali baveja: Heat.
Vishal Singh: on uh certain that we can start flagging in that gives us that this is a hole in the knowledge base right uh so that at least we are sure you know so Germany's world knowledge might be very good right but still if we if we you know because this will come very important down the line that how much is the knowledge coming from your sources so it has to be very sure because once it starts showing some surprises right and we come to know no it is coming from Germany's world knowledge and Germany's world knowledge is not coherent it can uh you know it can slip here and there we so I think this whole testing thing now uh we should really you really I'll discuss with you today but but carry on carry on with other points we'll we'll see so g what uh what uh we have learned from other projects is right uh because you the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
Vishal Singh: the AI can you know you ask the same question every time the answer will be different right uh so you need at least that it it is it's not diverging so much right the central thesis remains the So you know
 
 
00:14:31
 
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Vishal Singh: now now it's humanly not possible to test it because how many people you get right. So what people do is you you you actually you know use another AI you generate lot of this conversations and you have another AI to rank it not not foolproof but at least it's flags you know that uh what is
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Vishal Singh: it?
gitanjali baveja: So, you're basically improving your own precision using another AI tool to do it.
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are at least finding out whether there is any gap
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Vishal Singh: on
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh, okay.
gitanjali baveja: So one of the questions I think that that since we brought the subject up is when
Srinivasan H: Bit
gitanjali baveja: you um like we want like we had made the disclaimer already in case um the patients uh type in what lens should I select right we
Vishal Singh: Oops.
gitanjali baveja: had made the disclaimer you need to discuss it with your doctor. I think one of the other disclaimers that will be important once they um see and read anything that requires a payment, for example, a multif focal or a uh a phentoc whatever they need to click on a sentence that says I understand that insurance does not cover the fees for this lens.
 
 
00:16:00
 
Vishal Singh: That was Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: So because actually reading is different than reading and understanding and acknowledging.
Vishal Singh: Mhm.
gitanjali baveja: So I think that unless they click on that
Vishal Singh: Mhm.
gitanjali baveja: that it freezes the software from going to the next page or letting them click on another module. It could be a popup.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: And I know it sounds annoying,
Vishal Singh: It should get registered.
gitanjali baveja: but I think that PE patients don't they don't see enough
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: that you know they keep asking, well, does insurance cover it? No, it doesn't. If they click on it and they're like, I understand that insurance doesn't cover it. Uh and the other thing that they should understand I think that one of the things that should be another
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: popup with each lens is I understand like with a monopocal that I will have to wear glasses for all ranges of vision.
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: I might be less dependent on my distance but for the best corrected vision glasses will still be
 
 
00:17:04
 
Vishal Singh: Right.
gitanjali baveja: necessary and I think that should be
Vishal Singh: Got it.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got
Vishal Singh: And Shini we Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: good.
Vishal Singh: No. G carry on.
Srinivasan H: it.
Vishal Singh: I I have some other question.
gitanjali baveja: No, no,
Vishal Singh: No.
gitanjali baveja: go
Vishal Singh: So Shini, we have this information that this insurance covers this much.
gitanjali baveja: ahead.
Vishal Singh: This we have that.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, we have that part.
Vishal Singh: How how do we have that? But because it will be insurance based, right?
Srinivasan H: Not the insurance part for each lens how much it costs. Uh no insurance part we have not uh merged it yet because we have no idea which insurance the patient has. So we have not integrated that part at all.
gitanjali baveja: But insurance doesn't cover any of those specialty lenses.
Srinivasan H: Uh so the thing huh that we have attached it because that is generic for
Vishal Singh: A okay. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: all the patients right.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Vishal Singh: All right. Uh so G I was saying uh when uh when we saw a custom lens demo of Dr. Uh Dr.
 
 
00:17:57
 
gitanjali baveja: Mhm.
Vishal Singh: Yeah. So one one good uh I think what we saw was uh
gitanjali baveja: Milan.
Vishal Singh: uh I think there was a very good visual representation of uh what would happen later after so you could see this it was uh
gitanjali baveja: Yes.
Vishal Singh: so that's that uh and and you could do this you could do that
gitanjali baveja: How your vision would be.
Vishal Singh: and uh I think that's the only very very impressive thing conceptually I found in that product right so something something of that sort we can think as we go down the line so I'm not sure now uh was it was it a very generic thing
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Vishal Singh: or where I think it was a general thing but that time it it struck to me that people can tell that these are my interests this is what I want to do and you show them visually that this is possible this is not possible right and why I'm saying is because you have said that uh you know you you would will require a reading lens.
 
 
00:19:01
 
Vishal Singh: So it shows you that this is going to happen, right? It's not, you know, reading text and seeing something visually, you know, is is very different.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Vishal Singh: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Yes. So, I mean I I think that will be nice to add on as a feature,
Vishal Singh: Yeah. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: but maybe phase two.
Vishal Singh: Face. Yeah. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh the another point which you had mentioned is uh we need to change the wording on description of fios to all ranges of vision replacing all
gitanjali baveja: So I think in the monop focal yeah like you wrote remember we talked about this we said like it's a
Srinivasan H: distances.
gitanjali baveja: you said you going to have for multif focal you would have clear vision in all distances distance intermediate and near so you don't want to use the word all distances because it's confusing with distance as being you
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: know above six feet right so you want to say you you will you will not need glass or you know you will be less dependent on glasses for all ranges
 
 
00:20:02
 
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: of vision distance intermediate and near instead of saying all distances. Does that make sense?
Srinivasan H: got it. All inches of Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Because that wording can confuse if they say all distances does that mean I know
Srinivasan H: vision.
gitanjali baveja: what we're saying but I think it might be confusing when we're trying to use the word distance specifically for distance vision.
Srinivasan H: It's just replacing it with ranges of vision, right? Nothing
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: much.
gitanjali baveja: And maybe I wonder if it would be helpful and I don't know I understand this concept really well but let me let me get your take. Do you think it would be helpful for having when we talk about selection right in generic not their recommendations that we just before we talk about them just have one sentence saying that generally the human eye without cataract can see three ranges of vision. one at distance which is which is equal to your driving vision or anything you know or driving or watching TV.
 
 
00:21:19
 
gitanjali baveja: One we call it your intermediate vision which is usually around 20 in which is something like a screen or laptop or computer. And the third one your near vision and we define that as something up close like reading fine print in a book or on a prescription bottle. Bye,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Michelle.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, he dropped off.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: he's like,
Srinivasan H: Yeah,
gitanjali baveja: I don't need to do
Srinivasan H: I think this Okay.
gitanjali baveja: this.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I think this will be better because you understand those things but we don't understand as a general patients or someone they will not understand immediately what it is. So adding a description of this kind will be helpful.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, I think maybe in the OOL types, you know, just having that before we describe the OOLS. And the other thing, I forgot to mention this, but when we talk about mono focal and then we have a small sentence at the bottom saying if you have a stigmatism, you can get a TOIC option.
 
 
00:22:21
 
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: But it's in really small print.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: But it's important because if they select the mono focal to that's a cost to
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: them. So it needs to be in bigger print almost like a a a subheading of the
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: monopocal.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Just make it in a bigger font and make sure we say a sentence that the monop focal to is not covered by the monopocal single range vision is covered by insurance but the monop focal that corrects a stigmatism or the monopocal toric is not covered by insurance.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. I'll handle
gitanjali baveja: Okay, cuz I think we didn't really talk about toric except underneath each category cuz the
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: toric is actually in if you get a multif focal toric it's included in the price of the multif focal but if you get a monopocal toric people might get
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: confused think I'm getting monop focal it should be covered by insurance but the monop focal toric is not so I wonder if we should put it maybe as a separate category or make it maybe bigger or bolder as a subcategory monopoly.
 
 
00:23:41
 
Srinivasan H: Okay, I'll think how to display it properly so that it will
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: be h uh
gitanjali baveja: So that it's clear.
Srinivasan H: and one more part
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: is uh one more option that is common should be built-in mono vision. Yeah, this part mono vision what is that like? Go ahead and understand the mono vision
gitanjali baveja: that I think that's basically what I was Oh, mono vision. So,
Srinivasan H: part.
gitanjali baveja: I forgot totally to tell you about another option that patients choose. Okay, this is this is why this process is so confusing because this the wording is so simil similar. So, monop focal lenses are one range of vision, right?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Mono vision is also one range vision. Okay? And you're using a monop focal.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: But the difference is in mono vision, one eye is for distance and one eye is for close. So both of them have a monopocal lens which is covered by insurance.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
00:24:56
 
gitanjali baveja: You're less dependent on glasses because one eye is doing distance and one eye is doing up close
Srinivasan H: Okay. So it is a subcategory of uh uh
gitanjali baveja: monopocal.
Srinivasan H: monopocal.
gitanjali baveja: So if you want monopocal with both eyes at the same
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: range that's most you can even write most people opt for this. Some people want to be less,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and I'm giving you the exact wordings, some people want to be less dependent on glasses for no additional fees. They will choose or they will choose mono vision.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: And in this case, they receive a monopocal lens, but one eye is set for distance and one eye is set for either near or intermediate.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: The pros the pros are they're less dependent on glasses. Okay, they can still they may still need glasses um if they have a stigmatism unless they get the aigmatism corrected that with the toric they may um they may if they choose the mono vision for intermediate in the right eye or in what eye then they'll need glasses for near.
 
 
00:26:26
 
gitanjali baveja: If they choose glasses for near, sorry, the mono focal for near, they'll need glasses for
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: intermediate.
Srinivasan H: So is this then part of uh uh insurance or will it is it same like monopocal.
gitanjali baveja: It's the same like monopocal insurance because you're putting the same lens. You're just putting you're calculating the lens power for one range.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you get single range still but you've decided that this I is going to have the a power of minus3 or whatever for distance and this one will have a power of let's say minus or not not plus minus plus 13 this one will have power of plus 16 so it'll it'll cover your near vision you see what I'm
Srinivasan H: Okay. Good.
gitanjali baveja: saying but the the down.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. So I have to add this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. So, it's a sort of a subcategory of mono focal and
Srinivasan H: as
gitanjali baveja: it could be a drop down selection for the doctor too. Mono vision.
 
 
00:27:31
 
Srinivasan H: vision.
gitanjali baveja: But if the the cons the downside is
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: people have trouble getting used to it because think about your brain. it there is takes more time for the brain to adapt to getting used to the lenses. The second downside it does decrease your depth perception.
Srinivasan H: What does that mean?
gitanjali baveja: Your depth perception is your like you know if you're my hand is here and something is here I can gauge that it's at this distance right or when I'm taking when I'm walking down the stairs I know that that step is about one foot
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: lower the next step have you ever worn a new pair of glasses and you're all off and you feel like you're you don't know where to step sometimes because it throws off your depth perception your ability
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: to see stereo vision. So when you're because our ability to see depth is because both eyes are working together and we can gauge distance. The distance between objects,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: not just far away and close, but the distance between two
 
 
00:28:51
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: objects.
Srinivasan H: Does this doesn't this happen for all the lenses or is it particularly any kind of lenses?
gitanjali baveja: No, because if I put distance distance and I make you perfect vision here, perfect vision here for distance, both my eyes are working together at distance. I have perfect depth perception. If I put distance and near, my eyes are no longer working together.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: So your stereoscopic vision or your depth perception will decrease
Srinivasan H: But why will people even choose choose it then if that's the
gitanjali baveja: by some because people don't want to wear
Srinivasan H: case?
gitanjali baveja: glasses and some people actually do this with their contact
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: lenses. So they're used to having mono vision already because one eye and one contact lens is for distance, one contact lens is for near and they've been doing this for years. So they don't mind it. Their brain has already adapted.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So it generally works better in those who've already adapted to it with contact lenses or with lasex prior lasic surgery.
 
 
00:29:59
 
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: And so um and it's an option for in the light adjustable lens when the person has a light adjustable lens you can adjust it so one eye is distance one eye is near after they get the lens implant. Some people opt for that if they don't want to wear glasses. So it's just about like if you don't want to be dependent on glasses but you don't want to spend any money this is one way of doing it.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it.
gitanjali baveja: I don't choose it because I I can't handle like if one eye is different than the other,
Srinivasan H: And
gitanjali baveja: I throw up. Like I get nauseous.
Srinivasan H: that is why I asked you like who even chooses this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. You like it. My brain won't adapt to it. But there are people who wear contact lenses like that and they do it for years and so they've already adapted to it.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. I'll add this part uh as a subcategory. So yeah,
 
 
00:31:00
 
gitanjali baveja: Well,
Srinivasan H: I
gitanjali baveja: this was the feedback she gave me because she told she told me that they often have patients doing
Srinivasan H: can Okay,
gitanjali baveja: that.
Srinivasan H: got it. I think this is the things I think you had sent me. So any other thing you wanted to add on this?
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
Srinivasan H: Any part did we leave
gitanjali baveja: I think that's it. Did you get a chance to play around with the UX?
Srinivasan H: UX? Uh I have added the uh forms and documents. Uh I need to show you that part. Uh let me just show
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh so this is the doctor's side. Uh here you can see the uh part.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh so this is a clinical data. So when he comes to documents like uh for all the patients the documents will be
gitanjali baveja: Uhhuh.
Srinivasan H: same right the huh
gitanjali baveja: Uh, almost all the dog.
 
 
00:32:23
 
gitanjali baveja: Almost.
Srinivasan H: so once for all the doctor can upload here let's say he has uploaded this particular document here and for medical clearance and IO selection and for consent form he will upload it
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: here so once he uploads here uh automatically in the front end uh the
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: patient Uh okay where is I think before
gitanjali baveja: Oh, the patients can see it.
Srinivasan H: surgery huh yes so let's say for medical clearance I have uploaded
gitanjali baveja: Oh,
Srinivasan H: it so then the patient will be able to see it for the left eye right eye so if
gitanjali baveja: nice.
Srinivasan H: he clicks on download form the form will get downloaded and uh let's say in the
gitanjali baveja: Okay, good.
Srinivasan H: patient side in the doctor's side uh the doctor uploads after he signs the document and Let's say the doctor will upload it here. He has an option to upload the doctor. So once the doctor uploads the signed part uh immediately the patient will get it like
gitanjali baveja: Mhm.
Srinivasan H: this to view it or download it.
 
 
00:33:23
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Nice. Okay.
Srinivasan H: So he can view it and he can download it.
gitanjali baveja: Good.
Srinivasan H: Uh so this part is done.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Nice. Very nice.
Srinivasan H: uh and huh now the thing is the UX of the cubes. So what I'm thinking is see most people will uh I mean not most people
gitanjali baveja: Mhm.
Srinivasan H: I think 90 95% people will be using it in mobile Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: No, not because a lot of Well, maybe a lot of people maybe on their laptop because it's hard to read for a elderly patient on their mobile.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, do you think people will also use laptop for
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: this?
gitanjali baveja: I think they're going to go to the web based of their computer or laptop and use
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it.
Srinivasan H: Then uh so what I was thinking was to change the UI itself a bit different for the mobile view because I thought uh uh let me show how it looks in the mobile now.
 
 
00:34:28
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Were we able to play the colors or the shapes or anything? Or did you say it took takes a long
Srinivasan H: No, I I was not working on the UI.
gitanjali baveja: time?
Srinivasan H: I was actually working on actually we are working on a part where we are automating everything. I mean like uh I I'll explain you that workflow later.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: So uh this is how it us looks in the mobile view.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh but what I thought was like uh for mobile view we have to change uh the UI a bit different so that uh it is more interactive. Uh this what I felt was this looks odd and uh I have the designs for this.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: I have two or three designs. I'll share that with you. you can look into those designs and I'll implement it for mobile view and
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Okay.
Srinivasan H: uh related to this uh uh shape and uh the color uh I'll work on this this week either after showing the demo today or
 
 
00:35:32
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: tomorrow I'll start working on this if everything is
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: perfect.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. What is the uh what are your thoughts on the mobile demo? I mean the mobile you user interface.
Srinivasan H: uh here currently uh the patient has to click twice like this to uh open this interface
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: and uh this part I mean the popup it doesn't makes proper sense like uh it is in the mobile view it doesn't look good like uh this is horrible
gitanjali baveja: It's Yeah, it doesn't look as look It's too tedious.
Srinivasan H: so uh I'm thinking whether uh instead of uh
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: popup to open a new page and show clearly or uh do something else here itself like uh I'll show you the designs don't worry we will look into the
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Okay.
Srinivasan H: designs once and we will finalize that once for mobile view but for the laptop view this will
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: remain the same whatever it is uh just the
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
 
 
00:36:30
 
gitanjali baveja: I like this for the laptop view.
Srinivasan H: cubes colors we will change that's it and rest everything will remain same and
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, I like keeping this purple. Just the other faces of the cube.
Srinivasan H: Huh? Okay. And uh what is the name actually like uh should we work on it or like uh we should see it later? I mean the name of the domain for us. Currently I have kept it as uh I created a logo and I've kept it as mirror or something like uh if you want I'll change the names and whatever it
gitanjali baveja: Oh, like to see
Srinivasan H: is.
gitanjali baveja: mira that means let's uh Oh, that's a logo. Um,
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: mirror means to see in Spanish.
Srinivasan H: H yes so you can tell me the name if you want to change or whatever it is. Uh I think that is the later part but uh as the process we will also change this
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: and finalize everything.
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
 
 
00:37:43
 
Srinivasan H: Uh so uh I wanted to ask two things from you like uh one is about
gitanjali baveja: perfect.
Srinivasan H: the uh EMR part. Can you give me another EMR to test?
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. So, tomorrow with um we're going to get permission for if I'm hoping crossing my fingers that he says yes and doesn't change again. We're trying to get we're going to try to get permission for him to give us his EMR.
Srinivasan H: Okay, because that would help because uh we are just using one emr and even whatever questions I ask in the chat
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: but it is the same thing again and again so I don't
gitanjali baveja: same thing. Same thing. Yeah. So we were we need to um get permission and we can use his his
Srinivasan H: find okay that would help and uh one more thing was the HIPPA
gitanjali baveja: EMR
Srinivasan H: compliance so what do you think like is it a big process or what do we need to do for
gitanjali baveja: the HIPPA compliance um I don't know the whole process but I know that there is certain regulations and certain software that's hypoc compliant already.
 
 
00:38:51
 
gitanjali baveja: So, I don't think we have to reinvent the wheel here. We just have to I don't know if that can be built into the code to have those encryptions. Um, I think the fact that you have an OTP is really good because it's, you know, you don't it's because it's password sensitive and it's really only the patient can access it and it's always a new password. So I think that's a really good one good thing. But I would have to consult with somebody who's more knowledgeable on the tech side for HIPPO compliance. I mean in our field we just have a form. We just sign a paper and say it's like and you you sign the document saying you're HIPPA compliant. But when it comes to software you have to probably meet some standards and I don't know what those look
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: like from a technical perspective.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh and uh another part is uh currently we are using American Academy of Optal right. So for those documents we are free to use that or we need to do something on that part as
 
 
00:39:52
 
gitanjali baveja: Mhm.
Srinivasan H: well. Is it an open source or how is it?
gitanjali baveja: Um, which documents? Like the YouTube videos?
Srinivasan H: Not the YouTube videos. Uh YouTube videos and uh the documents which we have extracted
gitanjali baveja: Well, I mean If you go to American Academy of Opthalmology link and you
Srinivasan H: from.
gitanjali baveja: write that you're a patient, that's what you've been accessing. You haven't had to as a doctor, you get a different access to with a membership fee, but that goes into the publications and articles.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: We are not going into that. We're just going into the basic vault of patient information that it's open to the
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, we are free to use those we free
gitanjali baveja: public. It's open to the public. I don't see why not.
Srinivasan H: to
gitanjali baveja: It's It's open on the web to the public without a
Srinivasan H: okay because to
gitanjali baveja: password.
Srinivasan H: be on the safer side we should know whether it
 
 
00:40:55
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: is
gitanjali baveja: exactly. So, I'll find I can I mean I know people at the academy. I can find
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: out
Srinivasan H: Uh yes, I think this is what I wanted to discuss and these changes whatever you told I'll do it today so we can display it on the demo tomorrow.
gitanjali baveja: for the demo tomorrow. Okay, cool.
Srinivasan H: I'll also schedule a meet uh for
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: that.
gitanjali baveja: And I'll give you the cell um actually. Yeah, you'll you already have the email.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I have.
gitanjali baveja: Thank you.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh one thing like uh how were you able to log in like you said you were testing it right?
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, I just used the OTP thing.
Srinivasan H: Uh okay for which particular patient
gitanjali baveja: The same thing you showed me.
Srinivasan H: or for which one can I know uh
gitanjali baveja: I just used the California one something
Srinivasan H: let me just check.
gitanjali baveja: I center San Francisco and then I use 9999999 as my phone
 
 
00:41:54
 
Srinivasan H: Okay 999.
gitanjali baveja: number.
Srinivasan H: Okay got it.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: I was looking into it.
gitanjali baveja: that's how I use it.
Srinivasan H: I was looking like no clinics are registered and how are you even testing
gitanjali baveja: So,
Srinivasan H: it?
gitanjali baveja: I was using the one in San Francisco and I just copied what you did. 9999 then got the OTP in then put the OTP
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: in.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Fine. Good.
gitanjali baveja: You're doing too much work.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You're already forgetting how to log in.
Srinivasan H: No, I was thinking like how are you even logging in from which account? Because I I've never seen another clinic got registered.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's all I did.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Cool.
Srinivasan H: Anything else?
gitanjali baveja: That's it.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Then we'll connect again tomorrow.
gitanjali baveja: All right. Well, we'll talk tomorrow.
Srinivasan H: Yeah, sure.
gitanjali baveja: Thank you.
Srinivasan H: Uh 8:30,
gitanjali baveja: Thanks so much.
Srinivasan H: right?
gitanjali baveja: Have a uh Yeah.
Srinivasan H: 10 p.m. your time.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. 8:30.
Srinivasan H: Oh, sure.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Sure.
gitanjali baveja: Cool.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Thank you. All right. Good night.
Srinivasan H: Bye.
gitanjali baveja: Bye.

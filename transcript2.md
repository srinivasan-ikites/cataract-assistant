00:18:31
 
gitanjali baveja: Oh,
Srinivasan H: So what do you
gitanjali baveja: that's I like that
Srinivasan H: think
gitanjali baveja: idea.
Srinivasan H: because I thought it's the old patients they need to remember the password always like it'll be
gitanjali baveja: But they can they can do that.
Srinivasan H: like
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's fine. They can log in from their phone and they can still use a iPad or computer to do it though, right?
Srinivasan H: H. So I have done this OTP kind of system.
gitanjali baveja: Can we code as plus one?
Srinivasan H: Uh uh okay. Okay. Yeah. I I have to give an option for them to uh select
gitanjali baveja: But default option for plus
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: one.
Srinivasan H: Huh? Yes. Yes. Uh I can do that.
gitanjali baveja: Thank you.
Srinivasan H: No. So currently it's not integrated with real numbers as well because we have to uh if we are getting an OTP I think uh there is some system we need to pay. So currently since we are in uh development phase I've not taken that uh subscription or something you can enter uh so let's say uh when the doctor enters right I mean uh registers the clinic and then when he registers the first patient he gives one number okay
 
 
00:19:41
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: for uh uh so that number uh the patient has to enter it I mean it is his own number right
gitanjali baveja: All
Srinivasan H: so he has to enter his own number and uh he'll get uh the OTP just one
gitanjali baveja: right.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And for demo purposes, I know you've just mentioned MLAN Eye Clinic because that's the one I had sent you.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Well, the city had sent you,
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: but um I think that there is an existing MLAN Eye Clinic. So, we'd probably have to change that to something just like I don't
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: something,
Srinivasan H: Got
gitanjali baveja: you know, we can do like I don't know,
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: make up something like cloud eye clinic or
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. I'll change. Uh just give me a minute. I forgot the password. Just a minute.
gitanjali baveja: I think there was one extra nine in your password. Maybe that's what it was.
 
 
00:21:20
 
gitanjali baveja: There's too many N. Let go back to the um that other thing that you just showed. Yeah. How many nines are there?
Srinivasan H: Okay, there is 11 9.
gitanjali baveja: That's probably what it was.
Srinivasan H: Okay, but it doesn't accept. Okay, I'll log in with another account issues. I'll check the issues later. Okay. Just a minute. Uh, okay. Uh sorry. Uh there was some issues. Uh uh okay. Uh can you see the screen?
gitanjali baveja: I can
Srinivasan H: Okay. So last time we had this one issue like uh of your
gitanjali baveja: the act the vision was fine.
Srinivasan H: vision.
gitanjali baveja: The anatomical view was
Srinivasan H: uh the anatomical view actually have I have not changed the images but I have images
gitanjali baveja: wrong.
Srinivasan H: uh uh let me just show you the images I just want to confirm it once before uh
gitanjali baveja: That' be good. Let's go ahead and do all those.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So this is a normal eye that it gave
 
 
00:24:37
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: and nuclear
gitanjali baveja: Nuclear sclerosis.
Srinivasan H: solaris.
gitanjali baveja: But that's a that's good. But that's like a very advanced severe case. Most people don't have that advance. Um so let's show show like moderate nuclear sclerosis.
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: And then that cortical one is definitely wrong picture.
Srinivasan H: this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. cuz um let's
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: see cuz the iris is showing too much where the pupil needs to be bigger. You shouldn't see white streaks on the brown part of the eye. You see what I'm saying?
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Behind the brown part of the eye inside.
Srinivasan H: Here.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. All those lines like the radial spokes.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Let me show you.
Srinivasan H: But uh I'm not sure why it's not uh let me show you one more thing like here through Gemini also I tried to generate it. Uh,
gitanjali baveja: Again,
Srinivasan H: what about this?
gitanjali baveja: the pupil is way too small to show it.
 
 
00:26:01
 
gitanjali baveja: And that's just a big white thing. And that's like a anim that doesn't really I mean, so that's not a very good image. It doesn't look real.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Something real.
gitanjali baveja: The other one looked much better. Um, if you go The other
Srinivasan H: Oh,
gitanjali baveja: one was much better, but it's still not 100%. um like that is like nuclear sclerosis but like the image you currently have is good of nuclear sclerosis but do you know what I'm saying about the pupil which part of the eye is the pupil it's this it's the round margin here this circle that circle should be much bigger in
Srinivasan H: this one.
gitanjali baveja: our image so that you can see the actual cataract this actual grade of the cataract is fine I'm fine with this nuclear sclerosis the com the is not cortical part is not correct. Um,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: if you look at a cortical cataract, if you just go to Google for a second and generate images of a cortical cataract and go to images, not there yet, I'll tell you which one looks.
 
 
00:27:15
 
gitanjali baveja: So if you if you go So if you go to So if you go to the second row last picture, you can sort of see the white streaks almost like bicycle wheel. The Yeah.
Srinivasan H: this one.
gitanjali baveja: Like they're radial spokes where now look underneath that and look at that left picture.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You see that? Yeah. Or even Yeah. That's that's how it should show for cortical.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then nuclear, if you can just put that again. Again, the pupil size is bigger because the eyes you get a much better view when you have a larger pupil. I would say yeah. So like the first picture is really good because it shows the yellowing and so if you would have a normal you would just have a plain black inside that middle, right? It would be pl and then that's good cortical.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: That's cortical. So that's and if you look down a little bit,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it's cortical.
 
 
00:28:39
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. for nuclear cellularis like basically it should have this yellow yellow kind of uh uh layer outer
gitanjali baveja: No,
Srinivasan H: layer uh
gitanjali baveja: I What are you looking at?
Srinivasan H: nuclear
gitanjali baveja: What What are I'm not seeing any yellow.
Srinivasan H: I know this border one
gitanjali baveja: That's the iris. That's the normal That's the normal That's the colored part of like the brown part of your eye.
Srinivasan H: you
gitanjali baveja: That's not cataract. The middle middle part inside the black is all cataract because
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it's behind the iris, behind the colored part of the eye.
Srinivasan H: Oh, okay. Okay, I get it now.
gitanjali baveja: It's inside the eye. So, if you scroll down um
Srinivasan H: Oh.
gitanjali baveja: maybe like to the left and scroll, keep going. So, if you look all the way to the right, right there where there's a black circle, there's almost no cataract there inside the middle.
Srinivasan H: That's this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: Versus Um or just put um moderate actually type in moderate nuclear sclerosis.
 
 
00:29:57
 
gitanjali baveja: Just type that in. But don't write cataract. Just put moderate nuclear sclerosis and then see what happens and what images we get. Um similar go down just a little bit. Actually, the AI one that you generated for nuclear sclerosis is pretty good. It's just that the diameter of the pupil is too small.
Srinivasan H: Okay, I just need to increase this uh to a very big
gitanjali baveja: the yellowish in the middle,
Srinivasan H: extent.
gitanjali baveja: the very middle should be covering a hole inside of that new circle. That's what that should look. But now you know what the cortical should look like,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? It's all within within the b the the brown thing is just the colored part of the eye. That's the normal iris.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: That's if you look at anybody's eye, they have a color, right? blue, brown, green. That's not cataract. Behind that, inside one layer underneath is the cataract. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay,
 
 
00:31:17
 
gitanjali baveja: Because that center is just the pupil is just a hole where you're looking
Srinivasan H: got it.
gitanjali baveja: through
Srinivasan H: Okay, so to just enlarge this.
gitanjali baveja: exactly. And in the cortical, same thing to enlarge it.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And you should not have anything on the brown part of Yeah. So that's not if you look at the actual that's showing abnormality on the iris, not the lens.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: You see, if you go back to cortical on your Google images,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: right on that tab up there, you'll see it's inside.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: So, this person doesn't have a brown, they have a blue eye, right?
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You see the iris is bluish.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: So, just pretend that ours is brown, but inside is the cortical cataract. Or actually, look down to the left. need to Yeah, that one. No, one more to the right. Yeah, you see that? That's kind of a brown iris on the outside and in see the cataract.
 
 
00:32:28
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. See?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: See how you see the cataract inside with that
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: circle
Srinivasan H: Okay. It is here on the iris.
gitanjali baveja: on the so you can show it.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: This is a fine picture, but it's it's just in the wrong location. And the posterior subcapsular also the image was very grainy.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: What did you generate for that?
Srinivasan H: Uh posterior subcapsular. This
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: And again, the pupil should be much larger. That's a That's not a very good image of a posterior subcapsular cataract. It's almost like took paint and threw it on the back of the lens. So, if you look you um look at a Google image search, you'll see a better what I'm trying to get at. Maybe scroll down just a little bit. Um kind of like that probably a good um try to find a good example. Maybe that one right there.
 
 
00:34:19
 
gitanjali baveja: Um where there's a
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: arrow you can see like somebody just threw some color there in the middle of the lens except it shouldn't be
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you know this is a white it shouldn't be white. It should be more brownish nuclear on the other on the on the border of that. But they should be you see that central kind of splotch.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: But the rest of the cataract should look nuclear.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: That's too white of a border. Does that make sense?
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yes. Got it. This
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: thing.
gitanjali baveja: So somebody just took a little paintbrush and just dip dipped it in paint and put it on there. That's how it looks
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, here it is.
gitanjali baveja: like.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Got it. I think uh this car shell is uh somewhat uh correct right I mean it's inside
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: D.
 
 
00:35:59
 
gitanjali baveja: that's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good. Those are pretty good. Yeah,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: all those images are pretty good. The posterior subcaps is pretty good. Yeah, all of them are pretty good.
Srinivasan H: Okay. I'll just use them as reference. This AI sometimes it generates properly sometimes it all it I keep telling
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, it's a good one.
Srinivasan H: it it just keeps giving something
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: else.
gitanjali baveja: but that's the that's the hallucin I guess you call it hallucination effect. I don't
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I tried generating lot of things but it just use the same things. Okay, I'll uh check with that.
gitanjali baveja: So, but you get it.
Srinivasan H: Uh yes,
gitanjali baveja: You know now what's correct.
Srinivasan H: yes, I got it. Uh just the images.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: I'll I'll check with that images.
gitanjali baveja: The other the other thing I want to go over before we go to all of the each of the bot modules is the
 
 
00:36:59
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: FA because I think that some of the FAQs are they're
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: not um like yeah like we need to make sure we have
Srinivasan H: these are cues.
gitanjali baveja: good like the top ones that I think are important. I know this is generating some, but I want to make sure that one or two are definitely on the list
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: always.
Srinivasan H: So what generally like what do you think like what all should be there what type of
gitanjali baveja: This one is fine. This one is fine,
Srinivasan H: questions?
gitanjali baveja: but I'm I'm I want to make sure we go we just take a quick peek at each of them.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I don't think we need to have this. Did this Was this a AI generated FAQ? Why do I have multiple cataracts because you just have really one? I guess it's different types of cataract, but it's one disease. So, it might confuse the patient like they have two different things. But,
 
 
00:38:08
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: um,
Srinivasan H: This is where AI generated
gitanjali baveja: okay,
Srinivasan H: itself.
gitanjali baveja: you can leave that alone. That's fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Uh anything else on this particular page? My diagnosis I have increased the font weights as well like previously you told to increase
gitanjali baveja: No.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yes. Uh previously the same thing like you told to increase the font size and add this
gitanjali baveja: But I also would yeah you added that was and then uh below what is cataract
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: surgery is understanding your procedure options. Um what what is cataract surgery? That also should be a little bit larger.
Srinivasan H: h.
gitanjali baveja: I think. Don't you think it's too small? And the gray is very hard to see on white, especially for somebody who doesn't have good vision.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I don't think a color on our thing.
Srinivasan H: Okay. I'll just Okay.
 
 
00:39:26
 
Srinivasan H: I'll remove the grave wherever it is.
gitanjali baveja: You can just make it black or purple.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: Purple fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: the dark purple that'll that stands out.
Srinivasan H: Ah. Yes.
gitanjali baveja: So that'll be fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Got
gitanjali baveja: And yeah, make that a little
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: larger.
Srinivasan H: Yes. And I have added the extra part you told to add after
gitanjali baveja: Okay, good.
Srinivasan H: that.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: And I have changed it
gitanjali baveja: Standard insurance fun.
Srinivasan H: to
gitanjali baveja: Got
Srinivasan H: and
gitanjali baveja: it.
Srinivasan H: uh can just check this once.
gitanjali baveja: Are we allowed to use these videos from that website? Is there anything that says we can or can't
Srinivasan H: Uh basically they are YouTube videos right like we haven't taken from anywhere else it's just YouTube videos and we have also given the uh source of it so I don't think so it is an open source right like uh American academy is an open source I don't think so there's an issue taking the
 
 
00:41:03
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay. I just want to make sure we don't do anything get ourselves in
Srinivasan H: use because uh when they click on this
gitanjali baveja: trouble.
Srinivasan H: as well they will see uh that it is from uh American academy so I don't think so there is any issue in taking it the problem would have been likely if I had
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: downloaded the video and uh put it here uh but I have not done
gitanjali baveja: Okay, it's just a open source. Okay, that's good. And then yeah,
Srinivasan H: Uh these things are correct, right? Uh the content.
gitanjali baveja: and go back down so I can see the fto second laser
Srinivasan H: Uh okay.
gitanjali baveja: assistant.
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, perfect. I'm glad you added that there, too.
Srinivasan H: And uh this node is enough right like this is an advanced feature not covered by insurance.
gitanjali baveja: Yes. Um, I would
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: say, okay, that's good. That's good.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay.
 
 
00:42:26
 
Srinivasan H: Uh what I will
gitanjali baveja: Oh, wait. We didn't do FAQs. I'm sorry. On that one, can we go back and do look at the FAQs?
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh where's the FAQs? Okay, if not adult. Oh, one second. Like you can see the FAQs. Sorry, in the new one like when I was working on it, I've not added it. You can just check it here.
gitanjali baveja: So, one of the biggest FAQs we should put automatically, what is the difference between traditional and laser assisted cataract surgery? That should be a big question.
Srinivasan H: Uh yes.
gitanjali baveja: Most people will ask that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So what answer do you recommend for it an easier like proper way to tell them?
gitanjali baveja: Just copy and paste what we put for laser assisted because it show tells you what it does. Uses laser to make the incisions instead of a blade.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: That's what we I think we already wrote that as the description for laser.
 
 
00:43:57
 
gitanjali baveja: And then is can we see the answers to these just real quick?
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Um, I would say don't say you'll be at the clinic because that'll the patient. They're at the surgery center, not the clinic. You don't want them to show up to the wrong
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: place.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then let's get Okay. And what kind of anesthesia? So you also um it's not just local um
Srinivasan H: H should we use the name of any
gitanjali baveja: and no we b we so the kind of anesthesia
Srinivasan H: anesthesia?
gitanjali baveja: is called Mac anesthesia they don't need to know the name but just say they will get an IV sedation there you'll
Srinivasan H: Okay. I
gitanjali baveja: just and We don't do the injection around the eye like they do in India.
Srinivasan H: sleep.
gitanjali baveja: We just do the local drops and an IV sedation. So um local anesthesia which is numbing drops for the eye and
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: then um just say an IV will be inserted into your arm where and an anesthesiologist will inject mild sedit sedatives to help you stay calm and pain-free during the procedure.
 
 
00:45:47
 
gitanjali baveja: You will be semi awake during surgery is what I would say.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: And then that other question about what's the difference between another really important question I think
Srinivasan H: Huh? Okay, I'll add that particular thing.
gitanjali baveja: that's really should be on one of the FAQs is doesn't cover laser assisted surgery.
Srinivasan H: Uh, sorry, I didn't get him.
gitanjali baveja: Does insurance cover laser assisted surgery? And the answer is no.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It's very simple.
Srinivasan H: Yes. Okay, got it done. Uh yes,
gitanjali baveja: No.
Srinivasan H: I'll add those two questions as well. Uh so next is my options. So, it's just a small description here and uh you you can just check It.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's good.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So in the lens options,
gitanjali baveja: Let me just read that real quick. So,
Srinivasan H: yes,
gitanjali baveja: we don't want to use the word one distance because distance gets one range of vision.
 
 
00:47:56
 
Srinivasan H: one range of vision.
gitanjali baveja: because that range could be distance right so
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: that we don't want to confuse the person. So one range of vision and then you can keep that in parenthesis usually far away. This is the most common choice. Okay.
Srinivasan H: uh and then benefits and okay
gitanjali baveja: Okay. That's good.
Srinivasan H: uh should I keep standard lens or should I change it to monop focal lens because it is standard one right
gitanjali baveja: You can put standard slash
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: monifocal.
Srinivasan H: Okay. And uh I've given like it's covered by insurance.
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So this is the standard lens and uh the standard lens with uh laser
gitanjali baveja: So we want to say laser assisted
Srinivasan H: precision laser
gitanjali baveja: s because that's the accepted
Srinivasan H: assisted.
gitanjali baveja: term.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then You can we also want to put because the um wait go back to standard. Oh yeah, usually gives you clearer vision.
 
 
00:49:35
 
gitanjali baveja: Go back to that. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: So you only have excellent excellent distance vision for driving, watching TV. Um and then you you will need you also need glasses. Don't so this is on things to consider. Um you have to put you may need glasses for distance vision if you have a stigmatism remember cuz there doesn't
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you're not getting the stigmatism correction. So it's not perfect for distance. So you don't want to say it gives you gives you on here a reli the first sentence we don't want to mislead them. It says ar reliable lens that gives you clear vision at one range usually far away. And then you can put another sentence there saying if you have no aigmatism you do not you will you will not be dependent on glasses for your far away vision. But if you do have a stigmatism, you will need glasses for all ranges of vision
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh I have to mention that here itself in this particular description.
 
 
00:50:53
 
gitanjali baveja: because you just we just said you usually gives you clear vision at distance but if somebody has a stigmatism it's going to be blurry at distance right so standard lens is not correcting the aigmatism. So we need to say somewhere in this that usually gives you a clear vision far away. Um provided that you don't have much a stigmatism.
Srinivasan H: Thanks.
gitanjali baveja: If you have slight a stigmatism or if you have a stigmatism um glasses will be needed to correct the remainder or whatever the glasses will be needed for for distance vision or for far away vision because that's what we're
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: calling it. The other thing is like at the bottom things to consider.
Srinivasan H: close.
gitanjali baveja: You will need reading glasses for close-up tasks. Done. That's good. May need glasses for computer and intermediate not distance because that's confusing. Computer and intermediate range.
Srinivasan H: range.
gitanjali baveja: And then then you put the third point may need glasses for distance.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: If you haveism
 
 
00:52:00
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Got
Srinivasan H: Oh, yes.
gitanjali baveja: it.
Srinivasan H: Got it. I'm just moving it down. Okay. Got
gitanjali baveja: All right, let's go to standard lens.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: And you can open that up and then you'll fix this title, right? Laser
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: assisted.
Srinivasan H: I'll change the title and I'll change the color as well of this one. It's gray. I'll change it to blue.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Or purple or
Srinivasan H: H. Sorry,
gitanjali baveja: whatever.
Srinivasan H: purple.
gitanjali baveja: Um on the green part, the benefit is minimal dependence on glasses for distance or for far away vision.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Dependence. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Glasses for far away vision. or optimal far away vision without the need or I just say minimal dependence because you know anybody could put on a pair of glasses and it'll become a little bit sharper right so but they don't really need
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: them so I just put yeah minimal dep I think I'll just keep that that phrase minimal dependence on glasses far away vision
 
 
00:54:02
 
Srinivasan H: okay. Minimal dependency on glasses for far
gitanjali baveja: Uh,
Srinivasan H: vision dependence.
gitanjali baveja: not dependency but dependence on glasses for far away
Srinivasan H: Yeah. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: vision.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. And then under premium options, that gray thing that's you'll change
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: these advanced lenses can
Srinivasan H: Ah, yes. I will change this color.
gitanjali baveja: reduce. Okay. And so let's click on that. I think that's confusing. Far away to arms length. Um I would say see clearly for far away. No, I don't like the way that's worded.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Far away. No,
Srinivasan H: Uh so
gitanjali baveja: I like arms length, but see clearly for um for
Srinivasan H: from far away. Okay. Uh
gitanjali baveja: for distance range parenthesis driving or far away driving/far away. So see clearly for distance range and then in parenthesis we could put far away/driving
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and also computer or and also intermediate range and then parentheses arms length slash computer
 
 
00:56:38
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. So you're telling me we need to mention both uh the far and
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. And then a it but it doesn't help fine print or reading.
Srinivasan H: intermediate.
gitanjali baveja: So it it shouldn't say a great choice if you spend time on a computer or reading. Computer is fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Reading. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: doesn't really we need a a a great time if
Srinivasan H: Got it.
gitanjali baveja: you a great choice if you spend time um if you want to decrease your dependence on glasses for driving and using the computer make simple I would say
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: driving car I would say even make it even nice detail. A great choice if you spend time on driving, watching TV or use comma using the computer cuz like watching some people don't drive they they use the distance for like screens or TV.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So I would just say a great choice if you spend time driving,
Srinivasan H: Watching TV.
gitanjali baveja: comma, or using the
 
 
00:57:54
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: computer.
Srinivasan H: I have to remove the reading part. Okay. Okay. How about the benefits and things to consider?
gitanjali baveja: That That's correct. Distance to intermediate, fewer halos, and that are multifocal. Reduce dependence on glasses for most activities. Um may still need reading glasses for very small print. Premium cost is not covered by insurance. Okay, that's perfect.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Oh, you know what we should put on the benefits too because the m the EDOF um one of the green things is um a stigmatism correction um can be built into the lens.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. corrected by bolton
gitanjali baveja: built into the
Srinivasan H: lens.
gitanjali baveja: lens.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So I wouldn't say at all distances because distance means far right to people.
Srinivasan H: Vision range of vision.
gitanjali baveja: at all ranges of vision.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Um far, intermediate and near. The closest option to be glasses free after surgery. Clear vision at all again on the benefits ranges of vision.
 
 
00:59:44
 
gitanjali baveja: Um, and then you want to put parenthesis driving,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: watching TV, using the computer, and reading fine print.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Excellent for active lifestyles. Okay. Some people see halos around night. Brainy step. So, I would also say glare. So, notice glare and halos.
Srinivasan H: Okay, clear.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Hello.
gitanjali baveja: And then under benefits, a stigmatism um can also be built in this one. A stigmatism can be a stigmatism correction can be built into the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: lens.
Srinivasan H: Uh this is enough for the description or should I add uh more? I mean already why I have reduced it here is because already in what is
gitanjali baveja: Thank.
Srinivasan H: an module we have already told about multif focal so I don't want to again explain them in detail here as
gitanjali baveja: I see. No, I do think that after FAR, intermediate, near, we should put that in the benefits. I do think that we should put, you know, the descriptions of what FAR means, like driving, watching TV, using the and reading fine print.
 
 
01:01:20
 
gitanjali baveja: But that can be in the green box.
Srinivasan H: The reason I've kept this concise is because uh we already have here and what is an ol we have given in detail what each thing is multif focal again so I think we are repeating
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
Srinivasan H: something same so that's why I wanted to keep it minimal
gitanjali baveja: the language the language on what is an ol is correct to that we just corrected it here with like it r we didn't use distance we used range make that that's
Srinivasan H: Okay. Huh?
gitanjali baveja: all the same on that other module too okay and then we also include the watching TV
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yes. Yes.
gitanjali baveja: driving all of those things that we just said
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: You can check this once.
gitanjali baveja: um benefits.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: I think that we need to also say something in the in the description of light adjustable lens. Precise vision at one range chosen by the patient.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So things to consider you um you know you patient will have clear vision at the their range of choice whether it's computer or reading but they will have to wear spectacles or glasses for
 
 
01:03:10
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: the other ranges of vision because people are very confused when they pay so much.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: They're like why can't I see everything? Well, this is adjustable, but it it just adjust it adjust it perfectly to the range that you choose. So, we need to write a sentence there after that. Um, perfect if you want the most customized result possible and then add the sentence. Um the adjustment no you say the clearest vision is achieved in the range of vision that the patient chooses but in in a clear or clearest vision is achieved in only one range of v vision based on the patient's choice. the rem for example and then maybe we should give an example for example with patient or just say the the other ranges of vision will require spectacle correction.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So we definitely need to put that disclaimer there so people don't think people get confused between this and the multif focal otherwise
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Don't you think that uh we have mentioned here?
 
 
01:04:44
 
Srinivasan H: Can you check here? Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: No, we put that there. But um
Srinivasan H: I just wanted to understand is this correct here.
gitanjali baveja: that's correct.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yes. So, I'll add this here as well.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, just add it so that they don't I mean it at the other place but it make it similar to what you wrote
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. And then uh off multi focal light adjustable and this is a off plus laser assisted. Okay. And the heading laser assisted. I need to change. Oh, is this correct or any changes?
gitanjali baveja: for EDI
Srinivasan H: Huh? Ad off plus laser assisted.
gitanjali baveja: off best for patients who want the most accurate outcome because what does that mean to a patient?
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: Does that mean that they can get every they might get confused and think that they have all ranges of vision right?
Srinivasan H: Okay. Or precision. Is it
gitanjali baveja: I would best most
 
 
01:07:11
 
Srinivasan H: precision?
gitanjali baveja: advanced cataract
Srinivasan H: Okay. Most advanced
gitanjali baveja: surgery.
Srinivasan H: So it is because of the precision uh people uh opt for the
gitanjali baveja: Yes. This is a like it's like perfectly aligned like the lens is not off center nothing.
Srinivasan H: length.
gitanjali baveja: You know what I'm saying? It's really for the precision. All benefits of EDOF lenses.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Enhanced precision can address minor aigmatism. Higher premium cost may still need reader for prime brand. Okay.
Srinivasan H: So one doubt I have is like uh since this uh laser assisted is uh giving you the high precision like are people even opting for manual surgery manual uh laser manual I mean
gitanjali baveja: Well, sometimes the surgery centers don't even have the laser.
Srinivasan H: no
gitanjali baveja: Not every surgery center has a laser. So, they don't have. So, we have to give these choices.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then some that do have the laser because there's a cost of having that, you know, laser there and the technician and all that stuff, they have to put the cost to the patient.
 
 
01:08:32
 
gitanjali baveja: So, the patient might choose to have like if you were you and I would go for surgery, I wouldn't let anybody not do a laser on me. Of course, if you Why would I want somebody to use the blade and not the laser, right? Um but and I'll pay for it, but everybody doesn't want to pay for it either. So,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: the other thing we need I would say like this EDF plus laser the benefits um the things to consider we should probably copy and paste from the EDOF thing to consider.
Srinivasan H: Okay. The same thing might be.
gitanjali baveja: We should also include that you put higher premium costs, right? May but we should put those other things that so they don't forget those other things,
Srinivasan H: Huh.
gitanjali baveja: right? Because it still applies to
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: this
Srinivasan H: Okay. One is multif focal plus laser. Huh. I think even here I need to mention that uh precision advance.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
01:09:49
 
gitanjali baveja: Okay. And then the things to consider, same things include that highest premium
Srinivasan H: Copy and paste it. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: cost adjustment period. Include those two that you put.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So these are the normal options and below that the aigmatism to
gitanjali baveja: Um the toric wait what is the aigmatism correction plus
Srinivasan H: I mean it's to
gitanjali baveja: las well so that's the that's not the toric so that's
Srinivasan H: right.
gitanjali baveja: basically standard lens with laser stigmatism correction Okay. Noic lens would
Srinivasan H: So it is basically like the user can select any of the lens like either monopocal, multif focal, eff or uh something and on top of that this is an add-on right he can choose anything and he can take it.
gitanjali baveja: The laser you're saying is the
Srinivasan H: No uh I'm talking about the toric one.
gitanjali baveja: Adam.
Srinivasan H: So uh it is like uh let's say the patient either chooses monop focal multif focal eid of anything on top of that if he have aigmatism he can choose this uh uh toric one right
 
 
01:11:09
 
gitanjali baveja: No, you can't. Doesn't work that way. So that's why um
Srinivasan H: okay then uh how does this option works
gitanjali baveja: So the so the aigmatism can be corrected in two different ways. We can either cut make laser cuts on the cornea to correct mild aigmatism
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and it corrects that part or you can build the aigmatism correction into the lens itself and you don't have to have the marks on the cornea.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So I'm not sure So the toric correction the one is um the special lens designed to correct that's correct but a stigmatism correction that that one up there the mile a stigmatism correction plus laser is I would say toric a stigmatism correction with
Srinivasan H: H.B.
gitanjali baveja: toricol plus laser
Srinivasan H: Uh this one and this thing. Hello. Hello. Kate, am I audible?
Apoorv Gupta: Yeah, you are audible.
Srinivasan H: Okay, you're not audible to me.
Apoorv Gupta: Hi Shini.
Srinivasan H: Hi. Hi. I didn't remove you.
Apoorv Gupta: Uh huh.
 
 
01:13:11
 
Srinivasan H: How did you exit? I didn't remove you.
Apoorv Gupta: That's right.
Srinivasan H: How did you get exited?
Apoorv Gupta: I had actually some uh u network issues earlier.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So, I'm not sure what happened. I think I lost connection,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: but um so scroll up a little bit.
Srinivasan H: Uh is it visible?
gitanjali baveja: Um so,
Srinivasan H: Uh this one a matter
gitanjali baveja: yeah. So,
Srinivasan H: correction.
gitanjali baveja: we were up there. So, go all the way up to the top where before we get to that.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: So the standard lens plus laser is also gives you a stigmatism correction,
Srinivasan H: H but not 100% right.
gitanjali baveja: right?
Srinivasan H: It is just a small
gitanjali baveja: It'll give if you have minor aigmatism, it'll give you like 99% correction.
Srinivasan H: amount.
gitanjali baveja: It's good. So but you have to have small level of aigmatism for that to work. That's why it says this laser helps with minor aigmatism.
 
 
01:14:10
 
gitanjali baveja: That's where you right that's also that's fine.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: So we go down a little bit. So the EDOF has its toric that's fine. It has toric option. We wrote that down. Multif focal has a toric option. Then you have just the toric lens option which is the aigma.
Srinivasan H: H okay.
gitanjali baveja: And so just put toric ol toric intraocular lens
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: plus laser and toricol this next.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So instead of a stigmatism correction put or you can put a stigmatism correction with toricol plus laser on the I'm looking at the the one
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: above that.
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. a stigmatism correction with toric olus
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: laser. That's why it's more right. So that's toric that's you're you're using a toric lens implant and
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: you're using laser assisted to make the precision of the incision. That just gives the alignment of the lens. We're not really correcting a stigmatism this time with laser because the toric lens is correcting it.
 
 
01:15:21
 
gitanjali baveja: Right? So,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: so a stigmatism correction with toric IOL and laser.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, uh what about this then?
gitanjali baveja: Then you would just say to a stigmatism correction with toric and standard cataract surgery, no laser. So click on the learn more for the first one so we can make sure that's
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: good. So this would we need to write most accurate a stigmatism corre correction best for one range of vision usually
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: far. So we want to write that as one of our bullet points for the green. So best for one range of vision, usually far away. Minimal minimal minimal dependence on glasses for one range of vision and then parenthesis usually far away.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Got it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Um then that's fine. Things to consider higher cost. That's fine. So go down a little bit to a stigmatism correction toric. So you don't want to say sharper, clearer vision without glasses because this is just for distance.
 
 
01:16:57
 
gitanjali baveja: They'll still need glasses for reading and intermediate, right? So you can use copy and paste everything from the one above,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? And then um additional cost for toric feature um
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: lens will ma precisely position manually without laser without laser
Srinivasan H: manually without okay.
gitanjali baveja: incision.
Srinivasan H: Oh yes. Got it. Okay, got it. Then uh okay. Uh any any changes here apart from that?
gitanjali baveja: Um, I would just again copy and paste the benefits part
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: because you don't want to put sharper, clearer vision without glasses because again you're only doing one range of vision with this, right? same thing. It's really the same benefits um as the one we just did above except you don't have the laser benefits,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: right? So, we need to write that you know minimal distance minimal dependence on glasses for one range of vision parentheses usually far away. So, we need we just need to write that every time because so every time they choose something,
 
 
01:19:04
 
Srinivasan H: Okay,
gitanjali baveja: they want they're going to think about it in their mind. They're going to like, well, do I need to wear glasses? What do I need to wear glasses for? So, that's always have to be one of our bullet points to explain to them.
Srinivasan H: got it. Okay. Um okay that's it right uh then um my I opt so let's say this is uh $1,800 uh so will there be any extra charges along with this or uh this is The finalized fixed one. Oh, hello. Okay. Uh, am I audible?
gitanjali baveja: I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Srinivasan H: Ah, yes. Yes. Uh uh I was asking about this cost one.
gitanjali baveja: Cool.
Srinivasan H: So let's say it's $1,800 here for this thing. So uh is this finalized or will he need to pay anything extra?
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Like let's say in clinic there might be some extra charges. So will that be there or nothing will be there related to that?
 
 
01:20:50
 
Srinivasan H: I mean internally clinic I'm asking extra charges will he have or will this
gitanjali baveja: will the $8 is the extra charge?
Srinivasan H: Okay. No, apart from this, I'm asking apart from $1,800, will he have some extra
gitanjali baveja: Well, it depends. Like every patient has different insurance plans and so their insurance like you know how it says mostly
Srinivasan H: charges?
gitanjali baveja: covered by surgery by insurance, sorry, standard insurance. If the patient has a really bad insurance and they say we don't cover you, we only start covering your medical costs after whatever $2,000 are spent. then anything above, you know, any they have to build up to that 2,000 before insurance starts to cover it. So there may be more of a cost to this. This is just this is just general for the clinic to show the patient. I think this is where the surgical counselor still is needed a little bit because the patient's individual insurance is everyone's insurance is so different and their usage is different. So that's one of the things that we'll probably work on developing later is understanding the billing
 
 
01:21:53
 
Srinivasan H: Huh?
gitanjali baveja: process. I'll give you an example. Let's say every insurance company gives you something called a deductible and that deductible has to be met before insurance kicks in. So if my deductible is $500, right? I haven't used any medical service till my cataract surgery. I will have to pay $500 in addition to this $1,800 before
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: insurance. Let's say the cost of surgery is $650 standard cost of surgery, right? That first 500 I will have to pay and the insurance will cover the $150 difference, right? for the standard part because I will have met my deductible which is 500.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Now let's say I went to see another doctor like a GI specialist or my my you know cardiologist and I already spent $400 of my $500 deductible, right? Then insurance I only have 100 left to spend and then the insurance will start covering. So, if the standard surgery is $650, I'll have to spend $100 and what's left? $550 the insurance will cover.
 
 
01:23:22
 
gitanjali baveja: But everybody's different.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Everybody's used different services. So, like I don't know who's gone to their cardiologist and used what or who's gone to their dermatologist and used up part of their deductible. And some people have a $500 deductible. Some people have a $5,000 deductible. Some people have a co-pay. Some people have a percent that they have to pay with every surgery. So insurance won't cover 100% of the traditional surgery, but they'll say we'll cover 85%. So 15% will be left to the patient in addition to all of these out-ofpocket costs. So, it's a thing that you can look up once you put you enter that person's information into a let's say you have like a insurance company like Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is a standard one. If you go into their login page and go in and put the patient ID in, you can it'll up automatically at that moment in time what that patient's going to owe, what the what what they're going to cover. So,
 
 
01:24:19
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: but because it's individualized for each patient, that's something it's not ready to be integrated into our software. I don't think so yet. I think it's a lot of
Srinivasan H: Yes,
gitanjali baveja: work.
Srinivasan H: it requires a lot of work and it differs from different insurance, right? Like we need to be able to see all the insurance related
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. And so I want to do that at some point in the game when we get more
Srinivasan H: things.
gitanjali baveja: funding.
Srinivasan H: Okay. What? Okay. That's it here. Shall I move to the next one? Oh, yes. The risks and complications.
gitanjali baveja: So, I thought we were going to use that one page that I gave you all those risks and complications from that very
Srinivasan H: Yeah, I've pulled it from there. You can just check it whether uh it is proper or not. I I've just used that itself the
gitanjali baveja: Okay,
Srinivasan H: document.
gitanjali baveja: good. Okay, you can keep going down.
 
 
01:25:47
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Keep going down. So I don't want to put so go up for a second. I don't want to categorize them as treatable complications because infection
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: can be serious. You could go blind. You could lose your eye with it. So I think that's a very serious infection and I don't want to write typically manageable or whatever. um just infection I don't use it as
Srinivasan H: H. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: treatable just put it as additional I don't
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: know um
Srinivasan H: I can remove from treatable. Um
gitanjali baveja: I would just put you know lump everything into comp risks and complications and Don't categorize them as common and expected.
Srinivasan H: Okay, just put it
gitanjali baveja: Well, the common and expected uh or you know that's fine.
Srinivasan H: under.
gitanjali baveja: You can put that and then less common. Put less common complications and then put
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: infection. Bleeding. Um bleeding is very rare inside the eye but under
 
 
01:27:24
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: common bleeding on the outside on the white part of the eye is very common. We didn't write that. Can you pull up like are you able to pull up that
Srinivasan H: Okay. H yes. Once
gitanjali baveja: document?
Srinivasan H: again, So here it
gitanjali baveja: right right there. So mild
Srinivasan H: is.
gitanjali baveja: So, we forgot one on here. That's a mild discom that. I mean, I wouldn't say complications. I would say red I I don't want to put redness. Mild discomfort. Okay, that's fine. Intraocular bleeding. We'd have to put That's rare. that's bleeding inside of the eye.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Um, and then you need to write down that bleeding on the surface or on the white part of the eye um is common with you know during the procedure and resolves without intervention. So we should do two types of bleeding. One is bleeding you can put intraocular or inside the eye just put very And usually and resolves on its own.
 
 
01:29:24
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And usually resolves on its own.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then bleeding on the surface you can put that's where bleeding is visible on the outside of the eye. This also resol this is minor and resolves. This is minor commonly seen. This is commonly seen after surgery. It's minor and resolves without resolves on its own
Srinivasan H: Okay, this is when it bleeds on the outer
gitanjali baveja: on the surface. You can put on the or the or or noticeable
Srinivasan H: surface.
gitanjali baveja: noticeable broken blood vessels on the white part of the eye. You can write
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay, got it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Next.
gitanjali baveja: So then maybe you can go back to the main module and I can take a look at the other ones
Srinivasan H: Okay, I need to add one more row.
gitanjali baveja: and keep going down.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And I would say in severe cases for the corial edema in severe cases a corial transplant may be needed or you can just I mean
 
 
01:31:13
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: because just say this re this is you know mild swell I would say this I would make another sentence here under the black line um where it says usually Before that, after a clouding of the normal clear outer layer of the cornea,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: just say this cloudy appearance is common the first few days after surgery and it usually resolves with time.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Corp. I like that. Okay. This is about applications.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Well, the other ones the like infection is serious but rare, too. So, I don't like the way we've categorized them. So, I just kind of want to lump it to the the the first two are fine in the green section that you
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: did. The rest the rest should just be complications. Just list them as all complications.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So,
gitanjali baveja: We can describe Yeah.
Srinivasan H: I to put it as treatable and serious.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. I I mean we we should because infection is very rare.
 
 
01:32:45
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It's less than less than it's like one in 4,000 patients. So, but it's still and so it should be in this category. I don't like the idea of putting it in these categories because I want everybody all of the complications seriously.
Srinivasan H: Got it. Okay,
gitanjali baveja: But let's take a look at the uh serious but rare ones just to look at the what we wrote down for
Srinivasan H: I'll
gitanjali baveja: them.
Srinivasan H: serious.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, let's look at them the categories.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, retinal detachment. This can be repair surgery. Okay. And then here this may delay placement of the lens implant and require additional surgery.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, keep going. Let's look at the related ones. We didn't put serious but rare. Like we're not putting in the cateory, but we didn't put disloc. Oh yeah, I related. Do we put dislocation? You put decentration. Okay, good. That's fine.
 
 
01:34:52
 
gitanjali baveja: I wouldn't say need for glasses after surgery is a complication that
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: out.
Srinivasan H: Okay, I will remove
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: So and but under if you go up a little bit under um I will power calculation variability while while the method you use to calculate a final result may disre this can shift. So I don't want to write the IL can shift slightly as the eye heels that's not about power calculation.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: That's more decentation, right?
Srinivasan H: So,
gitanjali baveja: That's the shift from position. So take that sentence out. The ol can shift slightly as the eye heals.
Srinivasan H: okay.
gitanjali baveja: So but you need to add the sentence if the calculation is highly inaccurate and um the the lens may be may need to be exchanged for the correct lens.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Additional surgery may be required to exchange the incorrect I something like
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: that
Srinivasan H: Okay. But this has to be removed, right? The I can shift slightly as the eye heals.
 
 
01:36:24
 
gitanjali baveja: cuz that has nothing to do with the power calculation.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Basically,
Srinivasan H: Got it.
gitanjali baveja: if you calculate the wrong power and you put the wrong lens in, you have to go change, you have to put a different lens in. Some people will live with it and wear very,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: very thick glasses, but most people don't want to deal with
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Then Yes, this is all in the I
gitanjali baveja: Okay, I like tropia.
Srinivasan H: will
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's good. Um that's not very corial complications during laser
Srinivasan H: Hold
gitanjali baveja: procedure. I would it does not does not result in increased eye pressure. Where did we get that? Is that from the page that we used document?
Srinivasan H: on. Let me see.
gitanjali baveja: It would have been in the laser uh another page complications of laser assisted surgery. It wouldn't It's not in this section. It's in a different page. A different page.
 
 
01:38:23
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Um, braids. Okay. So, I would just say take Yeah,
Srinivasan H: I think here the corn is
gitanjali baveja: that we copied. This was a copied and pasted from somebody,
Srinivasan H: crash.
gitanjali baveja: but I don't think it's that accurate. If you go back to the um go back, I'll tell you what we need to change. So the cornea couldn't be scratched during the laser procedure. I wouldn't say anything.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: I just just say that um this causes um some this can cause moderate discomfort after for one or two days after the surgery and is treated with antibiotics. That's it.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It gets better by itself. Nobody has any increased pressure or fluid leakage from any of that. That's fine.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got
gitanjali baveja: Incomplete or offcenter cuts. Laser.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's fine. Capsule tear. So, capsule tear we've already talked about um in didn't we c didn't we write talk about that in the regular risks?
 
 
01:39:44
 
gitanjali baveja: We should That's a That's a
Srinivasan H: I don't think so. Capsule.
gitanjali baveja: regular risk capsular
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: tear.
Srinivasan H: Common and expected.
gitanjali baveja: I don't know. So, go back to the document again.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: The other part of the document. Keep going. One more page. One more. So, can you enlarge that a little bit for me? I can't see.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. So, and scroll up a little bit. Keep going down. The other way. Sorry. Other way. Keep going.
Srinivasan H: Come
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Good. Go up. Back up.
Srinivasan H: on.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, go back up. So, we Yeah, we need to go to the page with not the other complications. Yeah, that one. So, that it's number eight.
Srinivasan H: Rupture of the capsule that holds the lens implant of the capture which is an additional procedure.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, we wrote that.
 
 
01:41:08
 
gitanjali baveja: I think I think we have
Srinivasan H: Okay. Just one second.
gitanjali baveja: that.
Srinivasan H: Uh but uh it is where is it? It is not under common and expected. I think it is
gitanjali baveja: I don't Yeah, I don't want to use anything.
Srinivasan H: under
gitanjali baveja: Don't put anything in categories common, expected, serious. Just go we put look at
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: treatable cuz I I know we read that. Go down a little bit.
Srinivasan H: somewhere.
gitanjali baveja: No serious but rare. Go down of the capsule.
Srinivasan H: Here it
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. So I don't like the categories,
Srinivasan H: is.
gitanjali baveja: but so just lump everything together and just list the first two common ones first, but the rest just come lump together. So we don't eat that. That could happen with any surgery rupture of
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: capsule.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And then if you go back to the document. So copy and paste that whole thing.
 
 
01:42:22
 
gitanjali baveja: I don't think we copied and pasted that whole statement on number
Srinivasan H: uh yes I thought it was like too much of uh points so I thought I'll categorize uh I
gitanjali baveja: eight.
Srinivasan H: think it's confusing it's not proper I'll put it as it is how it is
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Yeah.
Srinivasan H: here
gitanjali baveja: So copy and paste that number eight as is. Okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And okay.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Got it. Okay. Then I'll just remove all these categories and it's fine, right? If I just put everything at once.
gitanjali baveja: Capsular tear is rupture of capsule.
Srinivasan H: At once.
gitanjali baveja: So take that out because the same thing
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: as
Srinivasan H: Z as well. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: yeah okay leave that one in prior refractive surgery. So I would keep this category separate the laser assisted category because that is a little bit different because if they don't they won't um and I won't I would put corial abrasion from the laser surgery into the the first risk that we put corial scratch.
 
 
01:43:45
 
gitanjali baveja: I would lump that in with any any cornea could be scratched any with any
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: surgery.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: It doesn't have to be laser related
Srinivasan H: So, okay. I got that one. So, now we are telling don't categorize like this. Uh just
gitanjali baveja: except the laser category. the cornea part you're going the corial scratch that's in the laser you're going to take and put it in the other section and we're not going to use any other
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: categories
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, I need to remove all these things. I need to merge all these things into one. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Yes.
Srinivasan H: Okay. You can check the FAQs for this.
gitanjali baveja: Let's see. Uh, okay. Let's go. Okay, keep going. Okay, keep going. Okay. Okay. Keep what's the warning signs? Oh, this is very good. I like this.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Then before surgery okay uh this is how it looks for before surgery.
 
 
01:46:27
 
Srinivasan H: Uh let's say the surgery date is on 28th Jan. I mean tomorrow. So we are on the third day before the surgery.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: So here it shows the morning drops, afternoon drops and evening drops the person has to take and
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: when clicked on it currently it just puts a tick mark. Uh so in the later stage when we move on like we'll create a notification or something when this particular time comes well a notification will come and they can take it that one small feature uh
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: and so it changes dynamically day by day as the day keeps changing before surgery and night
gitanjali baveja: Okay. It tells them it tells them which drop to take.
Srinivasan H: Uh okay I think I've not mentioned which but it is before surgery it is just only one drop right the antibiotics should
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, but but you know sometimes patients are on different eye medications,
Srinivasan H: be
gitanjali baveja: so we have to be very specific about what they're taking. So it I don't know if in the you know in the doctor's profile where we clicked on which antibiotic they have to take if it could go up here based on what the doctor
 
 
01:47:41
 
Srinivasan H: Mhm. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: clicked
Srinivasan H: Okay. We can just pull that and show that uh this is the antibiotic you need to take.
gitanjali baveja: or whatever bigox
Srinivasan H: H yeah I can just mention the type of ey drop. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: But you know how we have it in the doctor portal?
Srinivasan H: Okay. I'll show you.
gitanjali baveja: Don't we have like a drop down of the different options?
Srinivasan H: Yeah, we have a drop down. The doctor can select uh
gitanjali baveja: So should that shouldn't that selection come in
Srinivasan H: any uh yes,
gitanjali baveja: here?
Srinivasan H: I think I have I think I've not displayed it. Yeah, we will get that here. Correct.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh I'll just uh I'll just pull it and display it here.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. That one thing I'll note it down.
gitanjali baveja: I'm just grabbing some water on
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yeah. Yeah,
gitanjali baveja: here.
Srinivasan H: sure.
 
 
01:49:07
 
Srinivasan H: A day of surgery.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, I'm back. Sorry.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh, got it. Oh, yeah. I'll change that one. And uh, coming to the day of surgery, you had told a lot of changes previously. So, you can check it like you told to change these things.
gitanjali baveja: Mhm. And again, can we change all the gray like arrival time? That's so small.
Srinivasan H: Okay. The font size.
gitanjali baveja: all the way up there
Srinivasan H: Okay. The font size. I need to change it everywhere. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: where it says arrival time.
Srinivasan H: I'll
gitanjali baveja: It's so small. Nobody's going to read that.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it.
gitanjali baveja: Do you see that up there?
Srinivasan H: This one I'll write.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, that's too small
Srinivasan H: Got it. I'll change colors as well.
gitanjali baveja: location.
Srinivasan H: Like this gray. Shall I go on?
gitanjali baveja: Mhm. So un under IV,
 
 
01:50:50
 
Srinivasan H: Oh,
gitanjali baveja: um maybe we shouldn't say tube,
Srinivasan H: yes.
gitanjali baveja: but maybe we should just I would say catheter. That's the right word. Not really tube.
Srinivasan H: f****** okay. Change this. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Okay, that's good. But one thing I forgot to ask you in the day and before surgery, shouldn't we have forms and documents?
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: And remember that was one of our
Srinivasan H: What kind of document exactly?
gitanjali baveja: like a section where all of the patients forms and documents are available. For example, before surgery, they need a pre-operative clearance from their cardiologist or their primary care doctor, right? So, there's a form they have to have filled out.
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: So, they can always go back to their portal and download and print that form out. And once it's filled out,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: it can be uploaded by the surgical counselor to document section.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So that form will be given uh
gitanjali baveja: consent form even their consent form.
 
 
01:52:40
 
Srinivasan H: manually.
gitanjali baveja: So I think that that should be in before surgery there should be one like drop down
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: where all of the forms are available for them.
Srinivasan H: Okay. And uh will that form be same for all the patients in that particular clinic?
gitanjali baveja: this. Yes. Like the consent form will be the same. You saw the form that like the patient sign for like the which lens they wanted whichever. So all of those forms are there that you know in one place the patient can either see what they've already
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: signed or if they need to download a blank form they have the opportunity
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: to download the blank form because you know they take all this home maybe they have they
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: they go home and they have to decide whether they want to do it and they want to do their paperwork that before they see the surgical counselor they can download all of and then print it out and fill it out before they come.
 
 
01:53:49
 
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. I've not thought about it. Okay. So, there will be uh one is uh uh general concern form. So, it might have multiple pages. And uh another thing is uh the uh form
gitanjali baveja: No, I I would just say like before s under before surgery preparation,
Srinivasan H: that
gitanjali baveja: there should be a small menu on the top for that says forms and documents, right? And if they clicked on it,
Srinivasan H: here.
gitanjali baveja: it'll take them to all of the PDFs and those will be customized by whichever the clinic and I'll say every clinic is going to have a
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: pre-operative instructions, post-operative instructions, but they have their own handwritten or written form for that, right? Pre-operative instructions, post-operative instructions. um consent form and pre-operative clearance, medical clearance form.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Um I would say those are the main ones or lection form there might I I don't know which forms would you know which um final selection might be a form would say selection form so we don't have to put these in these are just something that they
 
 
01:55:21
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: they would put it like have the ability to scan in for the P.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: But we do want to incorporate the pre-operative medical clearance form.
Srinivasan H: So
gitanjali baveja: That's the only one and the consent form because the patient may want to, you know, download that and read it print read the print out version, right, based on the clinic. So, I won't put anything,
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: but we'll for the demo purposes just have a box saying forms and documents and then we'll incorporate PDFs of whatever forms that the clinic tells us they want that is from their clinic, right? Because it's going to have the clinic address and all the letter head on that
Srinivasan H: Mhm.
gitanjali baveja: clinic.
Srinivasan H: Got it. So the patient can download it and uh let's say he want he fills the premedical clearance form and he can uh
gitanjali baveja: Well, wouldn't fill it out.
Srinivasan H: after
gitanjali baveja: He would take it to his primary care doctor to fill it out and sign
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
01:56:26
 
gitanjali baveja: it. And the doctor can either choose to fax it. It'll have instructions on it, but it'll at least be available on the portable so the patient can always print it out.
Srinivasan H: Okay, got it. Uh, understood.
gitanjali baveja: But I think that these will just be generally uploaded by the surgical counselor as a
Srinivasan H: So,
gitanjali baveja: PDF.
Srinivasan H: huh? Yes, I think these forms are same for all the patients, right?
gitanjali baveja: Right.
Srinivasan H: So in the clinical data he can upload it once and for all the patients we can pull it
gitanjali baveja: Exactly.
Srinivasan H: and populate the same.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Exactly.
Srinivasan H: Got it. Okay. I think you have sent me all those forms or
gitanjali baveja: Well, I mean, I will just say let's just have a little box that says forms and documents.
Srinivasan H: uh
gitanjali baveja: And then when you click on it for demo purposes, there'll be a thing saying upload PDF and the surgical counselor can upload whatever they want to upload.
Srinivasan H: Okay,
 
 
01:57:23
 
gitanjali baveja: But we all,
Srinivasan H: got
gitanjali baveja: you know, but verbally we can give example,
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: but this would be the medical clearance form or their consent form, whatever the practice chooses to do.
Srinivasan H: Okay, I'll not Okay. Okay. day of surgery is done. Uh the uh so here this is how it looks. Let's say the surgery is done and it's day two of recovery.
gitanjali baveja: Mhm.
Srinivasan H: Like each day it just shows what all medications he needs to take. So here it shows
gitanjali baveja: What does it say? That title post say under the first one post
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: anti.
Srinivasan H: Okay. This this is the sorry this is the name of the antibiotic. Uh I have just put some random name for cooking
gitanjali baveja: Uh,
Srinivasan H: purpose.
gitanjali baveja: but it'll come up when the doctor chooses.
Srinivasan H: Uh so I have given some random name. So whatever doctor chooses there that will be populated here.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
 
 
01:58:36
 
gitanjali baveja: And then you'll change the gray,
Srinivasan H: H yes gray everywhere.
gitanjali baveja: right?
Srinivasan H: I'll remove the gray itself from our application.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: Uh it just shows and once he takes the drop he can just uh confirm it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: That is for the antibiotic and uh this is for the anti-inflammatory.
gitanjali baveja: So the remember the one very important thing is you've given timings for each of them not take the drop at the same
Srinivasan H: Hm.
gitanjali baveja: time. So like you have to space your drops 5 minutes
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: apart eight one's
Srinivasan H: Okay. But we need stops. H okay.
gitanjali baveja: 805
Srinivasan H: Got
gitanjali baveja: because otherwise they won't be effective.
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: The drops are not effective if you put them in at the same time. So if the noon one is noon, it should be 12:05, right?
Srinivasan H: H got it.
gitanjali baveja: Same thing. 4:05 night
Srinivasan H: Mhm. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: steroid.
Srinivasan H: Poststeroid or drops.
 
 
01:59:47
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: So this will change dynamically like depending on whatever the doctor selects. If he selects the combined drops then combined drops will be displayed. But uh that's how it will be just here to check it if it's completed.
gitanjali baveja: Okay. Okay.
Srinivasan H: uh so here I have one doubt so basically currently I'm just uh showing all these drops but I have never mentioned it whether it is for left eye or right eye so I have a doubt here so what are the chances of patients having uh the surgery on the same day for both eyes and what are the chances they have on different weeks or how do
gitanjali baveja: So usually they'll have one eye one day,
Srinivasan H: Hey
gitanjali baveja: one week and the next eye, the second eye they'll have either the two weeks later. So,
Srinivasan H: okay
gitanjali baveja: we need to have a scale for the right and the left.
Srinivasan H: h so uh I was thinking about it so what I thought is like uh let's say uh the left eye surgery is this week and right eye surgery is next week.
 
 
02:00:59
 
Srinivasan H: So what I'll do is I'll just display the first surgery which is going to happen on his left eye.
gitanjali baveja: And
Srinivasan H: So I'll just display the left eye related things here and for the right eye I'll just put a description that uh when the next week arrives or uh comes like we'll display the next one after the surgery is done after the drops are been done.
gitanjali baveja: then we have to that time we display both because he'll be finishing up the left before starting the right.
Srinivasan H: Uh
gitanjali baveja: And so if you scroll all the way up,
Srinivasan H: yes.
gitanjali baveja: definitely need to put down the which eye we're talking about.
Srinivasan H: Aha.
gitanjali baveja: And that and large very large all
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: caps.
Srinivasan H: H is there any chance that uh uh the surgery happens for both eyes on the same day?
gitanjali baveja: Uh very very rarely that happens.
Srinivasan H: So I can ignore that uh mostly
gitanjali baveja: No anybody that's doing
Srinivasan H: right. Okay. So
gitanjali baveja: that.
 
 
02:02:09
 
Srinivasan H: okay got it. Okay. Okay. This is just the UI separation for that. Uh I'll just check it. Okay. You can check this. Uh the last time you told to add this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. So, and significant pain not pro improving with um over-the-counter pain medications such as Advil or Tylenol because everybody doesn't use Advil or Tylenol.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Significant pain not improving with over-the-counter medications.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Should I remove that?
gitanjali baveja: just say not improving with over-the-counter medications.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Uh, okay.
gitanjali baveja: I think that's good.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So now uh the certain things are done. So now what whatever changes you have told now might requires two or three hours for me to complete it. I'll complete it. So what do you want now? Like uh should I deploy it and give both the uh doctor's version and the patient version? Uh uh will you test through it?
gitanjali baveja: Yes.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
 
 
02:03:54
 
gitanjali baveja: Can we can we do any should we talk about user interface at all
Srinivasan H: So,
gitanjali baveja: or
Srinivasan H: h yes, you can tell me if you have time now like you can tell me the user interface changes as well because the most of the content things are perfect, right? Just the small changes you have told today's that's
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: it.
gitanjali baveja: I think we've done a lot of work already on the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: content.
Srinivasan H: So now if you have time now you can take your time and you can tell me the uh user interface to change here.
gitanjali baveja: The purple, black, white. I do think that the cube should look more three-dimensional because I feel like we should have a different color for the top and the sides of the cube. Maybe like a lighter lavender. What do you
Srinivasan H: Yes, I think we discussed this previously.
gitanjali baveja: think?
Srinivasan H: I think we'll use some light lavender or light any light colors, peach or some light colors.
gitanjali baveja: I don't know if you want you are you able to pull up some cubes and show me or you want to um do that in later time?
 
 
02:04:56
 
Srinivasan H: If you have time like we can check it now.
gitanjali baveja: Let's check it now and just get it over with.
Srinivasan H: Okay. So, what uh colors do you
gitanjali baveja: I like the current color as a face. I was just looking for a contrast color.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So, we've shown the top of the cube a little bit lighter. We can even go one or two shades lighter or maybe opt for a totally different color like a
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: uh maybe like a a sage green or a light lavender. See if we can look at those two options.
Srinivasan H: Let me just Sage green. I don't think so it will match our because this is lavender
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: purple. I don't think so it'll match
gitanjali baveja: How about like a little bit of la like a lavender?
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: Like look at look up a light lavender like right there. 7443 C. That one. No. To the right.
Srinivasan H: This one this
 
 
02:06:24
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: that
Srinivasan H: This is uh Okay,
gitanjali baveja: or
Srinivasan H: this might look good. Okay, I think I can try this particular
gitanjali baveja: Um the other option
Srinivasan H: thing.
gitanjali baveja: is
Srinivasan H: Lavender.
gitanjali baveja: like teal looks good too.
Srinivasan H: Uh, sorry.
gitanjali baveja: Teal.
Srinivasan H: Which one?
gitanjali baveja: Look at teal. T E A
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: L
Srinivasan H: Light. Okay. Thank
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, like that. What What do you think about We can either go with a dark teal and the purple that looks good together.
Srinivasan H: you.
gitanjali baveja: Like look at um dark like Google dark teal with purple. So maybe if you look at the color palette, you see the that those colors look good together, but it might be too much. I don't know. I don't know. Teal looks good with orange. What about light orange?
Srinivasan H: light orange.
gitanjali baveja: like that third panel and that
 
 
02:09:15
 
Srinivasan H: But I don't think so orange and purple will match together. What do you think?
gitanjali baveja: I think I I think the I like the lavender and the teal better with the purple. But
Srinivasan H: I can try two colors I guess this lavender and teal. And I can also check with that light uh light lavender which we
gitanjali baveja: with purple just to have like it could be two of the
Srinivasan H: saw.
gitanjali baveja: same. And then I wonder if we can round the edges of the cube a little bit more.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: And what about the icons? What do you think about the icons?
Srinivasan H: H. So I think everything should be somewhat related to ice. That will make sense, right? Something related to ice we need to display.
Apoorv Gupta: Yeah. Uh in my opinion actually what is catact surgery and that what is I maybe you know we can change a bit but uh below three cubes are fine. I mean they are related to what they are displaying I guess.
 
 
02:10:37
 
Apoorv Gupta: Hello G has left the call.
Srinivasan H: Keith,
Apoorv Gupta: Are you in already office?
Srinivasan H: no,
Apoorv Gupta: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: I'm at home.
Apoorv Gupta: even I'm okay.
Srinivasan H: Wait.
gitanjali baveja: I don't know how I lost you again, but I was
Srinivasan H: Okay, no issues.
Apoorv Gupta: Even it's happening with me as well like I don't know why it's you know I am already removed
gitanjali baveja: talking.
Apoorv Gupta: from the meeting at time to
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, like after every like so often like it's just automatically removes me. Maybe there's time limit on the meeting.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Ah, yes. I think it's because of the time
gitanjali baveja: Maybe we're meeting for too long each
Srinivasan H: limit.
Apoorv Gupta: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: time. I'm falling
Apoorv Gupta: Mhm.
Srinivasan H: Uh yeah, the icons we were talking about. Uh so
gitanjali baveja: like I like the my diagnosis. Um,
Srinivasan H: H.
gitanjali baveja: I like the Well, um, I like the
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: but um, cataract surgery like should we come up with a different icon for that?
 
 
02:12:07
 
Srinivasan H: Yes. For what is catact surgery? What is an ol? I think something related to I kind of icons. I'll check it.
gitanjali baveja: Maybe I like what is an ol right and my options.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Have you seen a picture? Can you Google a picture of a multif focal I like an just a cool just a quick picture of it and go to images and go
Srinivasan H: Okay, good
gitanjali baveja: down.
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: Uh you go down a little bit. There's some good examples of Keep going. Can you do um Google multif focal with rings? So, I like that picture. You see how the little haptics kind of hang off the like
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: a It looks those little tails hang the
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: lens.
Srinivasan H: Okay. This one Yeah. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Sorry, I kicked off again.
Srinivasan H: Okay. It was removed again. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: So, let's see.
 
 
02:14:46
 
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, that P that picture is pretty good.
Srinivasan H: Able to see
gitanjali baveja: Like right up there. Like you see how you see the consent rings on the left?
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: Uh, click on that. No,
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: no, right to the left of that. Uh, no. Yeah, click on that image.
Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: Oh
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: yeah, click to go to
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: visit and let's see the im see if there's any images. Keep going.
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: Let's look on let me look on American Academy and see what's let me look at one of the images that I sending it to you that I like that we could easily we can our own you know it's easy to make it make this you just make a circle it circles
Srinivasan H: Are you
gitanjali baveja: This is perfect. Hold on a second. for an icon. I'm I'm going to send you guys a um
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: See this image I sent you guys
 
 
02:16:33
 
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: that could easily fun for that types of thing like that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Yes. Okay. I'll try to design this. Okay. I'm not sure why.
gitanjali baveja: I keep getting kicked off the
Srinivasan H: Oh,
gitanjali baveja: call.
Srinivasan H: I think you're an external participant. I think that's why next time I'll try to fix it.
gitanjali baveja: Okay.
Srinivasan H: There might be some issues.
gitanjali baveja: So, you that's there's like a circle in the middle where there's the lighter purple
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: color for all of them.
Srinivasan H: Uh for which one?
gitanjali baveja: All of them have a circle in the middle.
Srinivasan H: Huh?
gitanjali baveja: That lighter purple circle could be whatever contrast color we choose,
Srinivasan H: Yes.
gitanjali baveja: right? It'll be nice to keep the same dual tone. And the roof lighting of the boxes would be the second color, right?
Srinivasan H: Huh? The secondary color.
gitanjali baveja: So the secondary color could also be the background circle of the
 
 
02:18:16
 
Srinivasan H: Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: icon. So scroll down. I we'll keep that. will keep risks and complications before surgery, day of surgery, after surgery. After surgery, I don't think that it's a good icon there. The eye, what should we keep for
Srinivasan H: H after
gitanjali baveja: that
Srinivasan H: surgery
gitanjali baveja: or you could even put posttop icon. That's commonly used. Posttop icon.
Srinivasan H: posttop icon. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: Well, let's put let's put clear vision icon because after surgery they should good vision, right? Something that's like bunny or something that
Srinivasan H: H what I was thinking is like uh uh
gitanjali baveja: um
Srinivasan H: I I I icon and uh drops kind of thing. A small drop uh in the eyes or something.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: Uh that because um something like that. Yeah.
gitanjali baveja: Put eye put eye surgery icon.

02:20:26
 
Srinivasan H: catact surgery
gitanjali baveja: Yeah. Let's look at
Srinivasan H: icon. She
gitanjali baveja: Let's look at icons. Maybe it'll show like a dropper like a dropper bottle. Let's put ey drop icon. I think that looks nice. Like the one. Can we replicate something like that?
Srinivasan H: Which one? This
gitanjali baveja: That looks like a tear, but like with a dropper bottle like the on the top more to the right.
Srinivasan H: one.

Srinivasan H: This
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: That looks pretty simple, right?
Srinivasan H: Yes. This is what I was thinking. Something like this. A
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, but maybe change it a little so we're not plagiarizing.
Srinivasan H: drop.
gitanjali baveja: The eye could be really simple. It could just be like a Doesn't have to that you you know what I'm saying?
 
 
02:22:10
 
Srinivasan H: Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay. I'll try to customize it. Okay.
gitanjali baveja: and then
Srinivasan H: The colors and uh
gitanjali baveja: and then insurance.
Srinivasan H: insurance icon.
gitanjali baveja: Um, I would just put a dollar sign there, but I don't know if that's a
Srinivasan H: Insurance icons.
gitanjali baveja: I mean, I would just say like money icon, insurance
Srinivasan H: Yeah, basically that is what it represents.
gitanjali baveja: icon,
Srinivasan H: Insurance icons. Okay. It shows something like
gitanjali baveja: the I would just put like money icon because that's basically how much the patient
Srinivasan H: this.
gitanjali baveja: owes, right?
Srinivasan H: H
gitanjali baveja: Yeah, put money icon or
Srinivasan H: okay. something like related to money.
gitanjali baveja: no go back to that Google search and look at money icons and we'll pick one or just put money. Let's see what it comes up with because what if we use it in other
Srinivasan H: Dollar.
gitanjali baveja: countries?
Srinivasan H: How about this one? Or
gitanjali baveja: Um, I like that one better.
 
 
02:23:47
 
Srinivasan H: this
gitanjali baveja: I like the white one there in the middle down. Yeah, that one. That one looks simple. What do you think? Or should we holding a bill?
Srinivasan H: we
gitanjali baveja: The one on the left with the bill, the the one that you showed me uh with a hand.
Srinivasan H: this
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: one.
gitanjali baveja: that's more generic, right? Because then it could be any country's money,
Srinivasan H: Ah,
gitanjali baveja: right?
Srinivasan H: yes. That's why instead of dollars, we can
gitanjali baveja: kind of like the more outline look two two
Srinivasan H: put
gitanjali baveja: pictures to the right, but I like the bill. Like I don't like the hand all black. You see what I'm saying? I like it outlined, but instead of having the circle with the dollar, I have the bill.
Srinivasan H: where we can put a bill.
gitanjali baveja: Yeah,
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: let's do that.
Srinivasan H: Okay. Okay. Then I'll change it. Uh okay.
 
 
02:25:03
 
Srinivasan H: So this is for the uh currently it is for tablet view or uh uh the laptop's view like like let's say when I change it to mobile view I have a doubt actually what happens is like uh in the
gitanjali baveja: Yeah.
Srinivasan H: tablet or uh laptop when you hover on this using your mouse pad or something this rotates right but in terms of mobile no one will hover it people will try to just click So I think we need to do something else for the mobile view because no one is going to hover like this.
gitanjali baveja: Oh,
Srinivasan H: It's it's like a list, right? They'll try to
gitanjali baveja: maybe they just if it click they click it then it goes to the right
Srinivasan H: scroll.
gitanjali baveja: view
Srinivasan H: Uh so in the mobile view they cannot experience this kind of uh
gitanjali baveja: in the mobile do two clicks.
Srinivasan H: V
gitanjali baveja: They'll click it to rotate it and then click the rotation to get to that.
Srinivasan H: Okay.
gitanjali baveja: You see what I'm
Srinivasan H: Yes, I understand.
 
 
02:26:07
 
gitanjali baveja: saying?
Srinivasan H: But want it to be a two clicks for them. Unnecessary two clicks for
gitanjali baveja: Oh,
Srinivasan H: patients.
gitanjali baveja: if you say if it goes to my diagnosis, it automatically goes to the second clicked part.
Srinivasan H: This one we have to experiment with users. We are not sure because people some people will feel frustrated for two clicks. They need to click twice for opening that uh popup. Some will feel good.
gitanjali baveja: And
Srinivasan H: So based on user experience we have to see for that. Uh
gitanjali baveja: then one thing I forgot to ask under my diagnosis um and multif focal
Srinivasan H: yes.
gitanjali baveja: lens options are we need to make sure we specify which eye for the patient.
Srinivasan H: Okay. I think I'm just opening. Okay. I think we have mentioned your right eye and left
gitanjali baveja: Okay, good.
Srinivasan H: eye.
gitanjali baveja: I just want to make sure that we we are very clear which eyes for every section.

Srinivasan H: Got it.
